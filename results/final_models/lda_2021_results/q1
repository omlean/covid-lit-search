Frontotemporal dementia and COVID‐19: Hypothesis generation and roadmap for future research
Abstract: 
 The COVID‐19 pandemic has caused tremendous suffering for patients with dementia and their caregivers. We conducted a survey to study the impact of the pandemic on patients with mild frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Our preliminary findings demonstrate that patients with FTD have significant worsening in behavior and social cognition, as well as suffer greater negative consequences from disruption to health‐care services compared to patients with AD. The reduced ability to cope with sudden changes to social environments places patients with FTD at increased vulnerability to COVID‐19 infection as well as to poorer clinical and social outcomes. Caregivers of FTD patients also demonstrate high burden during crisis situations. A proportion of patients with FTD benefitted from use of web‐based interactive platforms. In this article, we outline the priority areas for research as well as a roadmap for future collaborative research to ensure greatest benefit for patients with FTD and their caregivers.

Respiratory and non-respiratory manifestations in children admitted with COVID 19 in Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil
Abstract: 
 Introduction: COVID 19 is still a challenge in pediatrics due to variety of symptoms and different presentations Aim: To describe clinical, laboratorial and treatment of confirmed COVID-19 pediatric admitted in hospitals. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in children (0-18 years), admitted between March and November 15, 2020, with confirmed COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or serological tests. Clinical data about symptoms, laboratorial exams and treatments were analysed. Patients were evaluated according predominant (PRS) or non-predominant respiratory symptoms (non-PRS) Results: Sixty-four patients were evaluated, being the median age 5.6 years. Forty-seven (73.4%) children were admitted with PRS and 17 (26.4%) with non-PRS. The main symptoms in the PRS group were fever in 74.5% of children and cough in 66%; and fever in 76.5% and edema/cavitary effusion in 29.4% in the non-PRS group. The median of C-reactive protein (in mg/dl) was 2.5 in the PRS group and 6.1 in the non-PRS group. Antibiotics were used in 85.1% of the PRS group and 94.1% of non-group. Comorbidity was present in 30/47 (63.8%) of PRS group and 8/17 (47.1%) of non-PRS group (p=0.22). Length of stay until 7 days in patients with comorbidity was present in 27/64 (42.1%) and more than 7 days in 11/64 (17.1%) (p= 0.2) Conclusion: Non-PRS represented more than one quarter of admitted patients. Fever was the main symptom detected, elevated CRP was frequent and antibiotics were commonly prescribed. Comorbidity was found in both groups and his presence was not associated with a longer length of stay.
