Coping in Familien mit psychisch erkrankten Mitgliedern
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND: Stress and coping during the lockdown in families with mentally ill members have not yet been described. AIM OF THE STUDY: First findings on this issue are to be gained in order to derive questions for further research. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Narrative interviews were carried out on a convenient sample of healthy families (n = 4), families with mentally ill children (n = 12) and families with mentally ill parents (n = 3). The quantifying evaluation of the in vivo codes assigned by two raters for the categories “problems” and “coping” was carried out with the help of numerical ratios and detailed analyses of the codes that differentiate between the families. RESULTS: The lockdown resulted in a large number of problems in all families. While in families with mentally ill children the restrictions were the biggest problem, families with mentally ill parents reported mainly about a lack of support. Families with sick members more often reported about risky coping patterns, in particular rumination and denial, and less often about protective coping, especially the mobilization of social support. CONCLUSION: Both risk groups require targeted interventions that focus in particular on adaptive parenting behavior and mobilization strategies.

Die Wirtschaftspolitik zurückgewinnen
Abstract: 
 Die genauere Analyse in diesem Kapitel zeigt, dass die Wechselkursschwankungen und Währungskrisen mit der Struktur des heutigen internationalen Zahlungssystems zusammenhängen. In ökonomischen Debatten kaum beachtet, werden internationale Zahlungen doppelt getätigt. Damit geraten Entwicklungsländer mit einem Leistungsbilanzdefizit in den Teufelskreis von Ressourcenverlust, Währungsabwertung und wachsender Auslandsverschuldung. Eine Reform des Zahlungssystems kann dieses Problem beheben.

Multicenter Evaluation of 434 Hospital Deaths from COVID-19. How can we improve End-of-Life Care during a Pandemic
Abstract: 
 CONTEXT: The pandemic has substantially increased the workload of hospital palliative care providers, requiring them to be responsive and innovative despite limited information on the specific end of life care needs of patients with COVID-19. Multi-site data detailing clinical characteristics of patient deaths from large populations, managed by specialist and generalist palliative care providers is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a large multicenter study examining characteristics of COVID-19 hospital deaths and implications for care. METHODS: A multi-center retrospective evaluation examined 434 COVID-19 deaths in 5 hospital trusts over the period 23/03/20-10/05/20. RESULTS: Eighty three percent of patients were over 70 and 32% were admitted from care homes. Diagnostic timing indicated over 90% of those who died contracted the virus in the community. Dying was recognized in over 90% of patients, with the possibility of dying being identified less than 48 hours from admission for a third. In over a quarter, death occurred less than 24 hours later. Patients who were recognized to be dying more than 72 hours prior to death are most likely to have access to medication for symptom control. CONCLUSION: This large multicenter study comprehensively describes COVID-19 deaths throughout the hospital setting. Clinicians are alert to and diagnose dying appropriately in most patients. Outcomes could be improved by advance care planning to establish preferences, including whether hospital admission is desirable, and alongside this, support the prompt use of anticipatory subcutaneous medications and syringe drivers if needed. Finally, rapid discharges and direct hospice admissions could better utilize hospice beds and improve care.
