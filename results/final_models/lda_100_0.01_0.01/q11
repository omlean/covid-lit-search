Role of Peripheral Analysis Methods in Adoption of Successful KPIs for a Research Institute Working Towards Commercial Agriculture
Abstract: 
 The outcome of the performance measurement would be more convergent at decision making if KPIs are tightly bound with organization culture along with organizational design. Peripheral analysis methodologies which are taken into the lens before the performance management have a major role in understanding the organizational culture and dynamism behind the organizational design to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities in a research institute's work for commercial agriculture development. The lack of a proper analyzing system to understand the critical success factors of a research institute towards innovative commercial agriculture has hampered the establishment of a good performance management system in research institutes towards this end. In this context, we highlight the most important avenues that could significantly improve the quality of performance, if used properly in the management of a research institute's work for commercial agriculture. How those management practices and tools could be streamlined by introducing new guidelines and policies in organization design have been elaborated. Further, it will provide an in-depth review of the most suitable peripheral analysis methodologies in place of the proposed structured procedure, to facilitate the selection process of obtaining an optimized KPI set. This KPI set, placed properly in the organization design, will direct performance drivers of a research institute to be on par with the competitiveness of the agriculture industry of a country.

End-to-End AI-Based Point-of-Care Diagnosis System for Classifying Respiratory Illnesses and Early Detection of COVID-19: A Theoretical Framework
Abstract: 
 Respiratory symptoms can be caused by different underlying conditions, and are often caused by viral infections, such as Influenza-like illnesses or other emerging viruses like the Coronavirus. These respiratory viruses, often, have common symptoms: coughing, high temperature, congested nose, and difficulty breathing. However, early diagnosis of the type of the virus, can be crucial, especially in cases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the factors that contributed to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic were the late diagnosis or misinterpretation of COVID-19 symptoms as regular flu-like symptoms. Research has shown that one of the possible differentiators of the underlying causes of different respiratory diseases could be the cough sound, which comes in different types and forms. A reliable lab-free tool for early and accurate diagnosis, which can differentiate between different respiratory diseases is therefore very much needed, particularly during the current pandemic. This concept paper discusses a medical hypothesis of an end-to-end portable system that can record data from patients with symptoms, including coughs (voluntary or involuntary) and translate them into health data for diagnosis, and with the aid of machine learning, classify them into different respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. With the ongoing efforts to stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease everywhere today, and against similar diseases in the future, our proposed low cost and user-friendly theoretical solution could play an important part in the early diagnosis.

COVID-19 Response Strategies at Large Institutes of Higher Education in the United States: A Landscape Analysis, Fall 2020
Abstract: 
 PURPOSE To examine the pandemic response plans of institutes of higher education (i.e., colleges and universities), including COVID-19 prevention, enforcement, and testing strategies. METHOD Data from the largest public (n = 50) and private (n = 50) US institutes of higher education were collected from October 30 to November 20, 2020. RESULTS Most institutes of higher education (n = 93) offered some in-person teaching in the Fall 2020 semester; most adopted masking (100%) and physical distancing (99%) mandates. Other preventive strategies included on-campus housing de-densification (58%), classroom de-densification (61%), mandated COVID-19-related training (39%), and behavioral compacts (43%). Testing strategies included entry testing (65%), testing at regular intervals (32%), population sample testing (46%), and exit testing (15%). More private than public institutes implemented intercollegiate athletics bans, behavioral compacts, and suspension clauses for noncompliance. CONCLUSIONS Variability in COVID-19 prevention and testing strategies highlights the need for national recommendations and the equitable distribution of sufficient pandemic response resources to institutes of higher education.

Confronting COVID-19-associated cough and the post-COVID syndrome: role of viral neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmune responses
Abstract: 
 Cough is one of the most common presenting symptoms of COVID-19, along with fever and loss of taste and smell. Cough can persist for weeks or months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, often accompanied by chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, dyspnoea, or painâ€”a collection of long-term effects referred to as the post-COVID syndrome or long COVID. We hypothesise that the pathways of neurotropism, neuroinflammation, and neuroimmunomodulation through the vagal sensory nerves, which are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, lead to a cough hypersensitivity state. The post-COVID syndrome might also result from neuroinflammatory events in the brain. We highlight gaps in understanding of the mechanisms of acute and chronic COVID-19-associated cough and post-COVID syndrome, consider potential ways to reduce the effect of COVID-19 by controlling cough, and suggest future directions for research and clinical practice. Although neuromodulators such as gabapentin or opioids might be considered for acute and chronic COVID-19 cough, we discuss the possible mechanisms of COVID-19-associated cough and the promise of new anti-inflammatories or neuromodulators that might successfully target both the cough of COVID-19 and the post-COVID syndrome.
