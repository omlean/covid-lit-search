COVID-19 Herd Immunity in the Absence of a Vaccine: An Irresponsible Approach
Abstract: 
 With SARS-CoV-2 continuing to spread rapidly throughout the human population, the concept of 'herd immunity' has been attracting the attention of both decision makers and the general public. In the absence of a vaccine, this entails that a large proportion of the population be infected to develop immunity that would limit the severity and/or extent of subsequent outbreaks. We argue that adopting such an approach should be avoided for several reasons: There are significant uncertainties about whether achieving herd immunity is possible. If possible, achieving herd immunity would impose a large burden on society. There are gaps in protection, making it difficult to shield the vulnerable. It would defeat the purpose of avoiding harm caused by the virus. Lastly, dozens of countries are showing that containment is possible.

The Impact of Staying at Home on Controlling the Spread of COVID -19: Strategy of Control
Abstract: 
 Abstract In this paper, we present a new mathematical model to describe the evolution of the COVID-19 in countries under the state of emergency. Where the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping country after country. The Italian and Moroccan authorities have declared a state of emergency in response to the growing threat of this novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak by March 09 and 20, respectively. In-state of emergency, citizens cannot go out to public spaces without special authorization from local authorities. But after all these efforts exerted by these authorities, the number of new cases of the COVID-19 continues to rise significantly, which confirms the lack of commitment of some citizens. First, we aim to investigate the cause of new infections despite all strategies of control followed in these countries including media reports, awareness, and treatment, self-distancing and quarantine, by estimating the number of these people who underestimate the lives and safety of citizens and put them at risk. To do this, we use real data of the COVID-19 in Italy and Morocco to estimate the parameters of the model, and then we predict the number of these populations. Second, we propose an optimal control strategy that could be the optimal and the efficient way for the Moroccan and Italian authorities and other countries to make the state of emergency more efficient and to control the spread of the COVID-19. The model is analyzed for both countries and then to compare the implications of the obtained results. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the strategy of control that we propose and to show what would have been happened in Morocco and Italy if this strategy of control was applied early.

Preliminaries on a Stochastic Cellular Automaton Based Framework for Studying the Population Dynamics of COVID-19
Abstract: 
 The propagation of infectious diseases through social interactions can be mitigated when health measures aim to reduce or remove the results of these interactions This is the scenario of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adopted quarantine policies, from social distancing to lockdown, and of immunization programs When a sufficient number of interactions is suppressed, the spread of an infectious disease is ended achieving herd immunity, defined as the indirect protection given by immune individuals to susceptible individuals Here we describe the preliminaries of a stochastic cellular automaton based framework designed to emulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a population of static individuals interacting only via Moore neighbourhood of radius one, with a view to analyze the impact of initially immune individuals on the dynamics of COVID-19 This impact was measured comparing a progression of initial immunity ratio from 0 to 90% of the population with the number of susceptible individuals not contaminated, the peak value of active cases, the total number of deaths and the emulated pandemic duration in days A herd immunity threshold of 60% was obtained from this procedure, which is in tune with the estimates of the currently available medical literature Nevertheless, more accurate results demand more research efforts including better analysing the model probabilities of propagation and duration Â© 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG

An Optimal Lockdown Relaxation Strategy for Minimizing the Economic Effects of COVID-19 Outbreak
Abstract: 
 In order to recover the damage to the economy by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many countries consider the transition from strict lockdowns to partial lockdowns through relaxation of preventive measures In this work, we propose an optimal lockdown relaxation strategy, which is aimed at minimizing the damage to the economy, while confining the COVID-19 incidence to a level endurable by the available healthcare facilities in the country In order to capture the transmission dynamics, we adopt the compartment models and develop the relevant optimization model, which turns out to be nonlinear We generate approximate solutions to the problem, whereas our experimentation is based on the data on the COVID-19 outbreak in Sri Lanka

Delaying the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic with travel restrictions
Abstract: 
 Objectives: Travel restrictions is an often-used tool for governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19 Methods: We here used a simple simulation model to investigate the potential effects of travel restrictions within a country Results: We found that travel restrictions can delay the peak of the epidemic considerably, but do not affect the spread within the country We also investigated the effect of implementing travel restrictions early or later in the epidemic, and found that fast implementation is crucial for delaying the epidemic Conclusions: Fast implementation of travel restrictions is crucial for delaying the peak of a subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 within a country
