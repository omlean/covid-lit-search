Accounting for variation in and overuse of antibiotics among humans
Abstract: 
 Worldwide, antibiotic use is increasing, but many infections against which antibiotics are applied are not even caused by bacteria. Over-the-counter and internet sales preclude physician oversight. Regional differences, between and within countries highlight many potential factors influencing antibiotic use. Taking a systems perspective that considers pharmaceutical commodity chains, we examine antibiotic overuse from the vantage point of both sides of the therapeutic relationship. We examine patterns and expectations of practitioners and patients, institutional policies and pressures, the business strategies of pharmaceutical companies and distributors, and cultural drivers of variation. Solutions to improve antibiotic stewardship include practitioners taking greater responsibility for their antibiotic prescribing, increasing the role of caregivers as diagnosticians rather than medicine providers, improving their communication to patients about antibiotic treatment consequences, lessening the economic influences on prescribing, and identifying antibiotic alternatives.

Antibiotic usage in 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) treatment: a rapid review on frequency, indications, and efficacy
Abstract: 
 OBJECTIVES: To report available information in the literature regarding frequency, indications, types of antibiotic usage, duration, and their efficacy in Covid-19 patients. METHODS: The search was conducted on April 30 and May 7, 2020, using Ovid database and Google search. Patients’ characteristics, clinical outcomes, as well as selected characteristics regarding antibiotic use (indication, class used, rates and types of bacterial secondary and co-infection, and duration of treatment) were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen clinical studies reporting data from 2834 patients were included. Mean rate of antibiotic use was 74.0 % of cases. Half the studies reported occurrence of a bacterial co-infection or complication (10 studies). Amongst the latter, at least 17.6 % of patients who received antibiotics had secondary infections. Pooled data of 4 studies show that half of patients receiving antibiotics were not severe nor critical. Detailed data on antibiotic use lack in most articles. CONCLUSIONS: The present review found a major use of antibiotics amongst Covid-19 hospitalized patients, mainly in an empirical setting. There is no proven efficacy of this practice. Further research to determine relevant indications for antibiotic use in Covid-19 patients is critical in view of the significant mortality associated with secondary infections in these patients, and the rising antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19: rapid review and meta-analysis
Abstract: 
 OBJECTIVE: The proportion of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 that are prescribed antibiotics is uncertain, and may contribute to patient harm and global antibiotic resistance. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and associated factors of antibiotic use in patients with confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature on human subjects in English up to June 9, 2020. Inclusion criteria were any healthcare settings and age groups; randomized controlled trials; cohort studies; case series with >10 patients; experimental or observational design that evaluated antibiotic prescribing. The main outcome of interest was proportion of COVID-19 patients prescribed an antibiotic, stratified by geographical region, severity of illness, and age. We pooled proportion data using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We screened 7469 studies, from which 154 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic data were available from 30,623 patients. The prevalence of antibiotic prescribing was 74.6% (95% CI 68.3 to 80.0%). On univariable meta-regression, antibiotic prescribing was lower in children (prescribing prevalence odds ratio (OR) 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.33) compared to adults. Antibiotic prescribing was higher with increasing patient age (OR 1.45 per 10 year increase, 95%CI 1.18 to 1.77) and higher with increasing proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (OR 1.33 per 10% increase, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.54). Estimated bacterial co-infection was 8.6% (95% CI 4.7-15.2%) from 31 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Three-quarters of patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics, prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated prevalence of bacterial co-infection. Unnecessary antibiotic use is likely high in patients with COVID-19. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (ID CRD42020192286).

Antibiotic Prescribing Patterns at COVID-19 Dedicated Wards in Bangladesh: Findings from a Single Center Study
Abstract: 
 Background: As evidence is mounting regarding irrational and often unnecessary use of antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic a cross-sectional Point Prevalence Survey (PPS) (in accordance with WHO guideline) was conducted across COVID-19 dedicated wards in Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). Methodology: Antibiotic usage data were collected from 193 patients at different COVID-19 dedicated wards at DMCH on 11 June 2020. Comparisons in antibiotic usage were made between different groups using Pearson chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. Result: Findings reveal all surveyed patients (100%) were receiving at least one antibiotic with 133 patients (68.91%) receiving multiple antibiotics. Overall, patients presenting with the severe disease received more antibiotics. Third-generation cephalosporins (i.e. ceftriaxone) (53.8%), meropenem (40.9%), moxifloxacin (29.5%), and doxycycline (25.4%) were the four most prescribed antibiotics among surveyed patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was independently associated with multiple antibiotic prescribing. Abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum d-dimer were linked with higher odds of multiple antibiotic prescribing among study patients. Conclusion: Prevalence of multiple antibiotic prescriptions was high among severely ill patients and those with abnormal CRP and d-dimer levels. Data regarding the quality of antibiotic prescribing were lacking.
