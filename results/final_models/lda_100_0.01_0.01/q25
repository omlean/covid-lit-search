A case series of flight attendants at risk of COVID-19 in South Korea in 2020
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected many individuals worldwide. Individuals in contact with unspecified people during their work, may be at risk of occupational exposure. On June 22, 2020, 1,435 overseas patients were identified in the Republic of Korea. Considering the influx of overseas patients, aircraft-mediated COVID-19 transmission is a major concern. CASE PRESENTATION: We presented two flight attendants diagnosed with COVID-19 who shared the crew's resting area and ground transportation, and discussed the risks experienced by flight attendants. CONCLUSIONS: Biosafety guidelines for cabin crews should be intensified, and their COVID-19 risks must be further investigated. Policymakers must consider comprehensive surveillance systems for workers with high risks of occupational exposures and transmissions, such as flight attendants.

COVID-19: An Army Brigade Approach to Tracking, Management, and Treatment of Soldiers, US Army 18th Military Police Brigade
Abstract: 
 As SARS-CoV-2 spread throughout the world military units had to develop ways of combatting risk to ensure force health protection and deployability of their soldiers. Medical functions were impacted and solutions needed to be found in order to incorporate these items as functioning medical platforms. In the following article, we address one unit's individual response to the difficulties faced as a Military Police Brigade in Europe. Lessons learned from the initial wave of COVID-19 across medical operations, medical readiness, virtual health, and behavioral health initiatives can be utilized for better planning and response in the future.

Covid-19 Grounded Aircraft - Parking and Storing
Abstract: 
 Air transport industry is one the many sectors significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic Travel restrictions and bans resulted in reduction in aircraft operation Airlines have no option than to limit their services by grounding their fleet: as of April 2020, out of 22,000 passenger aircraft around the world, almost 14,400 were grounded [1] Airport operators are trying to accommodate most of the grounded aircraft by utilizing their main operational space as aprons, taxiways and runways The limited space at airports often means that aircraft have to be parked in non-standard positions, which may affect the airport daily operations While planning aircraft parking, safety is the top priority The effect of long-term load was not considered in the pavement design and could result in increased pavement maintenance requirements Airport operators must also reflect aircraft maintenance needs in terms of engines, hydraulics, braking system, cabin interior and others [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Komunik√°cie is the property of University of Zilina and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )

Analytical approach to solve the problem of aircraft passenger boarding during the coronavirus pandemic
Abstract: 
 The corona pandemic significantly changes the processes of aircraft and passenger handling at the airport. In our contribution, we focus on the time-critical process of aircraft boarding, where regulations regarding physical distances between passengers will significantly increase boarding time. The passenger behavior is implemented in a field-validated stochastic cellular automata model, which is extended by a module to evaluate the transmission risk. We propose an improved boarding process by considering that most of the passengers are travel together and should be boarded and seated as a group. The NP-hard seat allocation of groups with minimized individual interactions between groups is solved with a genetic algorithm. Then, the improved seat allocation is used to derive an associated boarding sequence aiming at both short boarding times and low risk of virus transmission. Our results show that the consideration of groups will significantly contribute to a faster boarding (reduction of time by about 60%) and less transmission risk (reduced by 85%) compared to the standard random boarding procedures applied in the pandemic scenario.

Genomic Evidence of In-Flight Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Despite Predeparture Testing
Abstract: 
 Since the first wave of coronavirus disease in March 2020, citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand have been required to undergo managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for 14 days and mandatory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of October 20, 2020, of 62,698 arrivals, testing of persons in MIQ had identified 215 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 86 passengers on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that arrived in New Zealand on September 29, test results were positive for 7 persons in MIQ. These passengers originated from 5 different countries before a layover in Dubai; 5 had negative predeparture SARS-CoV-2 test results. To assess possible points of infection, we analyzed information about their journeys, disease progression, and virus genomic data. All 7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were genetically identical, except for a single mutation in 1 sample. Despite predeparture testing, multiple instances of in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission are likely.
