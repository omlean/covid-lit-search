Drug Fever Due to Favipiravir Administration for the Treatment of a COVID-19 Patient
Abstract: 
 A 55-year-old Japanese man was hospitalized with the novel coronavirus disease. On the 13th day after the start of favipiravir administration, the patient developed a fever with a temperature of 38.1Â°C. His pulse rate also became elevated to 128 bpm, so relative bradycardia was not suspected. Since he was in good overall health and no concomitant symptoms and signs were apparent, we considered it to be drug fever due to favipiravir. After the completion of favipiravir treatment, the patient's temperature normalized within 24 hours. We herein report this case of drug fever caused by favipiravir.
