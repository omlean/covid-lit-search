Two tobacco retailer programmes in Banyuwangi, Indonesia: a qualitative study
Abstract: 
 INTRODUCTION The tobacco retail density in Indonesia is very high, and tobacco companies are creative at promoting their products at point of sale (POS). The study explores the strategies employed by tobacco companies through their retailer programmes in Banyuwangi, Indonesia. METHODS In 2019 we conducted observation and indepth interviews with the owners/keepers of 12 retailers with Sampoerna Retail Community (SRC) signs and 6 retailers with Gudang Garam Strategic Partnership signs placed as store names in front of their stores. We analysed the data to identify key strategies used by each tobacco company. RESULTS Gudang Garam promoted more visibility of their own products, while Sampoerna promoted their products in a power wall and also rearranged other products sold in the store to attract more customers. Sampoerna educated their retailers to attract and retain more customers by using schemes such as reward points and coupons. Sampoerna also developed and promoted the use of a mobile application for online sales. CONCLUSIONS Both programmes promote product and brand display at retailers to create brand loyalty. The SRC mobile application for online sales is potentially attractive to young customers and allows for data collection about retail and customer purchase behaviours that can be used for tailored marketing. Tobacco sales promotion strategies should be strongly regulated. Banning indoor tobacco advertisement, promotion and tobacco display at POS should be encouraged.

[MinIP technique in COVID-19 pneumonia
Abstract: 
 One of the rarely reported computed tomography findings of COVID-19 is an air bubble sign. Minimum intensity projection (MinIP) images can increase the prominence of the air bubble appearance, which is one of the low-density findings observed in COVID-19 pneumonia. We present two cases with COVID-19 pneumonia, who were not optimally selected on thoracic tomography images, and air bubble appearance was detected in MinIP images. While air bubbles are not noticed in normal thin-section computed tomography images, they become more easily noticeable after the MinIP technique is applied. This observation needs to be confirmed by radiological studies.

Imaging Artifacts of Nonadhesive Liquid Embolic Agents in Conventional and Cone-beam CT in a Novel in Vitro AVM Model
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND A major drawback of liquid embolic agents (LEAs) is the generation of imaging artifacts (IA), which may represent a crucial obstacle for the detection of periprocedural hemorrhage or subsequent radiosurgery of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This study aimed to compare the IAs of Onyx, Squid and PHIL in a novel three-dimensional in vitro AVM model in conventional computed tomography (CT) and cone-beam CT (CBCT). METHODS Tubes with different diameters were configured in a container resembling an AVM with an artificial nidus at its center. Subsequently, the AVM models were filled with Onyx 18, Squid 18, PHIL 25% or saline and inserted into an imaging phantom (n = 10/LEA). Afterwards CT and CBCT scans were acquired. The degree of IAs was graded quantitatively (Hounsfield units in a defined region of interest) and qualitatively (feasibility of defining the nidus)-Onyx vs. Squid vs. PHIL vs. saline, respectively. RESULTS Quantitative density evaluation demonstrated more artifacts for Onyx compared to Squid and PHIL, e.g. 48.15 ± 14.32 HU for Onyx vs. 7.56 ± 1.34 HU for PHIL in CT (p < 0.001) and 41.88 ± 7.22 density units (DU) for Squid vs. 35.22 ± 5.84 DU for PHIL in CBCT (p = 0.044). Qualitative analysis showed less artifacts for PHIL compared to Onyx and Squid in both imaging modalities while there was no difference between Onyx and Squid regarding the definition of the nidus (p > 0.999). CONCLUSION In this novel three-dimensional in vitro AVM model, IAs were higher for the EVOH/tantalum-based LEAs Onyx and Squid compared to iodine-based PHIL. Onyx induced the highest degree of IAs with only minor differences to Squid.

Chest-CT mimics of COVID-19 pneumonia-a review article
Abstract: 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in early December 2019 in China, as an acute lower respiratory tract infection and spread rapidly worldwide being declared a pandemic in March 2020. Chest-computed tomography (CT) has been utilized in different clinical settings of COVID-19 patients; however, COVID-19 imaging appearance is highly variable and nonspecific. Indeed, many pulmonary infections and non-infectious diseases can show similar CT findings and mimic COVID-19 pneumonia. In this review, we discuss clinical conditions that share a similar imaging appearance with COVID-19 pneumonia, in order to identify imaging and clinical characteristics useful in the differential diagnosis.

Chest CT Imaging Features of Typical Covert COVID-19 Cases
Abstract: 
 Purpose: To analyze the chest CT imaging findings of patients with initial negative RT-PCR and to compare with the CT findings of the same sets of patients when the RT-PCR turned positive for SARS-CoV-2 a few days later. Materials and methods: A total of 32 patients (8 males and 24 females; 52.9±7years old) with COVID-19 from 27 January and 26 February 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Clinical and radiological characteristics were analyzed. Results: The median period (25%, 75%) between initial symptoms and the first chest CT, the initial negative RT-PCR, the second CT and the positive RT-PCR were 7(4.25,11.75), 7(5,10.75), 15(11,23) and 14(10,22) days, respectively. Ground glass opacities was the most frequent CT findings at both the first and second CTs. Consolidation was more frequently observed on lower lobes, and more frequently detected during the second CT (64.0%) with positive RT-PCR than the first CT with initial negative RT-PCR (53.1%). The median of total lung severity score and the number of lobes affected had significant difference between twice chest CT (P=0.007 and P=0.011, respectively). Conclusion: In the first week of disease course, CT was sensitive to the COVID-19 with initial negative RT-PCR. Throat swab test turned positive while chest CT mostly demonstrated progression.
