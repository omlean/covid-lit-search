Predictive Parameters of Decreased Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Strain at 1 Month After Pediatric Heart Transplantation
Abstract: 
 Previous reports indicate that the decreased left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) seen in the early postoperative period of pediatric heart transplant patients generally recovers over the course of 1–2 years. In this study, we investigate the predictive capacity of preoperative parameters on the LVGLS decline seen at 1 month post transplant. Forty-six transplant subjects with 2D echocardiographic images sufficient for speckle tracking echocardiography were enrolled. We excluded patients diagnosed with cardiac allograft vasculopathy or with an episode of rejection 1 month before or after their echocardiographic examinations. The mean LVGLS was significantly reduced at 1 month when compared to 1 year following transplant (− 15.5% vs. − 19.4%, respectively, p < 0.001). The predictors of LVGLS that decline at 1 month were the LV mass z-score [odds ratio (OR) 1.452; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.007–2.095, p = 0.046], recipient age (OR 1.124; 95% CI 1.015–1.245, p = 0.025), and donor age (OR 1.081; 95% CI 1.028–1.136, p = 0.002) in the univariate logistic regression analyses. Although multivariate analysis yielded no significant predictors, higher LV mass z-scores showed a trend associated with the decline of LVGLS (p = 0.087). The donor/recipient weight ratio was associated with the LV mass z-score (R(2) = 0.412, p < 0.001).

SARS-CoV-2-Specific Cell-Mediated Immunity in Kidney Transplant Recipients Recovered from COVID-19
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND The magnitude and kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific cell-mediated immunity (SARS-CoV-2-CMI) in kidney transplant (KT) recipients remain largely unknown. METHODS We enumerated SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon-γ-producing CD69 CD4 and CD8 T-cells at months 4 and 6 from the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 21 KT recipients by intracellular cytokine staining. Overlapping peptides encompassing the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein N-terminal 1- to 643-amino acid sequence and the membrane protein were used as stimulus. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies targeting the S1 protein were assessed by ELISA at month 6. RESULTS Detectable (≥0.1%) SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T-cell response was found in 57.1% and 47.4% of patients at months 4 and 6. Corresponding rates for CD8 T-cells were 19.0% and 42.1%, respectively. Absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell counts increased from month 4 to month 6 in CD8 (P-value = 0.086) but not CD4 subsets (P-value = 0.349). Four out of 10 patients with any detectable response at month 4 had lost SARS-CoV-2-CMI by month 6, whereas 5 out of 9 patients mounted SARS-CoV-2-CMI within this period. All but two patients (89.5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Patients lacking detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 response by month 6 were more likely to be under tacrolimus (100.0% versus 66.7%; P-value = 0.087) and to have received tocilizumab for the previous COVID-19 episode (40.0% versus 0.0%; P-value = 0.087). CONCLUSIONS Although still exploratory and limited by small sample size, the present study suggests that a substantial proportion of KT recipients exhibited detectable SARS-CoV-2-CMI after 6 months from COVID-19 diagnosis.

Changes in the rate of cardiometabolic and pulmonary events during the COVID-19 pandemic
Abstract: 
 Background The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to influence the rate of cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications. We set out to measure the overall rate of events over time. Methods Working on behalf of NHS England, we used data from the OpenSAFELY platform containing data from approximately 40% of the population of England. We selected the whole adult population of 17m patients and identified three mutually exclusive groups: hospitalised with COVID-19, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and everyone else. We then counted rates of death, DVT, PE, ischaemic stroke, MI, heart failure, AKI and diabetic ketoacidosis in each month between February 2019 and October 2020. Outcome events were defined using hospitalisations, GP records and cause of death data. Results For all outcomes except deaths there was a lower count of events in April 2020 compared to a year earlier. For most outcomes the minimum count of events was in April 2020, where the decrease compared to April 2019 in events ranged from 5.9% (PE) to 40.0% (heart failure). Deaths saw an increase of 73.4% between April 2019 and April 2020. Despite the hospitalised COVID-19 population making up just 0.14% of the population in April 2019, they accounted for a high proportion of events in that month (range of proportions 10.3% (DVT) to 33.5% (AKI)). When only counting the events in people with a record of COVID, the decrease was much greater, ranging from 23.0% (stroke) to 50.5% (heart failure). Interpretation We observed a large drop in recording of all cardiometabolic and pulmonary complications in the non-COVID general population, alongside frequent occurrence of these outcomes in patients hospitalised with COVID.
