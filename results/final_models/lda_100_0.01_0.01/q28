Changes in psychotic-like experiences and related influential factors in technical secondary school and college students during COVID-19
Abstract: 
 OBJECTIVE Although students have been found to be at high risk of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the pandemic's impact on psychotic-like experiences (PLEs). We conducted a study in technical secondary school and college students before and during the pandemic to explore changes in PLEs and relevant influential factors. METHODS A total of 938 students completed both waves of the survey through electronic questionnaires. PLEs were assessed using the 15-item Positive Subscale of the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE-P15). Childhood trauma, perceived stress, resilience, and demographic factors were evaluated at baseline, and psychological status was measured during the pandemic. RESULTS The overall CAPE-P15 scores significantly decreased during the pandemic. Students with persistent PLEs showed the most severe COVID-19 related psychological symptoms, followed by new-onset and remitted individuals; those without PLEs exhibited the mildest symptoms (all p < .001). A single parent family (OR = 4.707), more childhood trauma (OR = 1.056), and a higher family income (OR = 1.658) were predictive of new-onset PLEs during the pandemic, while better resilience was a protective factor, associated with remission of previous PLEs (OR = 0.932). CONCLUSIONS Despite a downward trend in the prevalence of PLEs during the pandemic, PLEs predict greater serious psychological impact due to COVID-19, especially for students with persistent PLEs. Interventions that cultivate students' resilience are urgently needed to reduce PLEs and improve mental health, especially for students from single parent households or those who have experienced childhood trauma.

Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in Children and Adolescents during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Transcultural Approach
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND Despite being necessary to delay the spread of COVID-19, home confinement could have affected the emotional well-being of children and adolescents. Knowing which variables are involved in anxiety and depressive symptoms could help to prevent young people's psychological problems related to lockdown as early as possible. This cross-sectional study aims to examine anxiety and depressive symptomatology in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese children and adolescents in order to determine which variables are related to poorer well-being during the pandemic. METHOD The parents of 515 children, aged 3-18 years old, completed an online survey. Children's anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale-Parent Version, and depressive symptoms were measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire-Parent Version. RESULTS We found differences in anxiety and depression between countries, with higher anxiety scores in Spanish children, and higher depression scores in Spanish and Italian children compared to the Portuguese. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were more likely in children whose parents reported higher levels of stress. CONCLUSIONS These findings are discussed in the light of detecting and supporting affected children as early as possible.

Left-behind children's social adjustment and relationship with parental coping with children's negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic in China
Abstract: 
 Using data collected from two provinces in China through an online survey, the current study aimed to investigate left-behind children's emotional and academic adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. The participants included 1780 left-behind (960 boys) and 1500 non-left-behind (811 boys) children in elementary and junior high school with a mean age of 11.23. Self-reported questionnaires concerning children's depression, loneliness, anxiety, and academic adjustment, and parents' coping with children's negative emotions were completed. The results suggested that compared with non-left-behind children, left-behind children's depression and anxiety symptoms were more severe and their academic adjustment was poorer. However, left-behind children had lower levels of loneliness than non-left-behind children. Additionally, supportive coping types, especially emotion-focused and problem-focused reactions, were significantly negatively correlated with children's depression and anxiety. Unsupportive coping types, especially distress and punitive reactions, were significantly positively correlated with children's depression and anxiety symptoms. Moreover, the relationships between punitive reactions and depression, ignoring and loneliness and problem-focused reactions and academic adjustment were significantly stronger in left-behind children. Hence, during the pandemic, left-behind children were still at a disadvantage even with their parents' company. However, parents' coping style towards left-behind children's negative emotions played a significant role in their adjustment.

 OBJECTIVE This study was conducted to determine the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on children's lifestyles and anxiety levels. METHODS This study was designed as a descriptive, cross-sectional online questionnaire survey. RESULTS Of the children, 91.9% reported that the pandemic had an important effect on their lifestyle. Children stated that they experienced changes in terms of nutrition, sleep, television-internet use, social activity, coursework time, and school success due to the pandemic. IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE It was determined that the COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in children's routines, and the children experienced moderate or high levels of anxiety. Primary healthcare providers should increase their attention to these issues to protect and improve children's mental health during the pandemic period.

Mental Health and Physical Activity among Children and Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic
Abstract: 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing disruptions in the global social system. Japanese children and adolescents have had their schools closed, government-mandated activity restrictions imposed, and interactions outside the home reduced. These restrictions can have a considerable psychological impact on children and adolescents. This review aims to describe the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity and psychological status of this population. The review was conducted by searching PubMed for information on the impact of COVID-19-related activity restrictions on children and adolescents. The search identified 11 articles, three of which contained data on anxiety and psychological problems due to physical inactivity. Next, a PubMed search was conducted about physical activity and psychological status in children and adolescents under psychological stress. The search identified 368 articles, 28 of which were included in the review. For children, data that revealed a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and sedentary time leading to mood disorders were included. For adolescents, there were nine studies that reported a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and four studies that reported no correlation between physical activity and psychological health. Of the studies that reported a correlation, seven reported that physical activity improves psychological health. The impact of psychologically stressful situations such as COVID-19 on children and adolescents has been experienced worldwide. Physical activity has been correlated with psychological health, and it may improve psychological status; physical activity should be recommended to better support the psychological health of children and adolescents under the influence of COVID-19.
