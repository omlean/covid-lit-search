Deep learning approaches for challenging species and gender identification of mosquito vectors
Abstract: 
 Microscopic observation of mosquito species, which is the basis of morphological identification, is a time-consuming and challenging process, particularly owing to the different skills and experience of public health personnel. We present deep learning models based on the well-known you-only-look-once (YOLO) algorithm. This model can be used to simultaneously classify and localize the images to identify the species of the gender of field-caught mosquitoes. The results indicated that the concatenated two YOLO v3 model exhibited the optimal performance in identifying the mosquitoes, as the mosquitoes were relatively small objects compared with the large proportional environment image. The robustness testing of the proposed model yielded a mean average precision and sensitivity of 99% and 92.4%, respectively. The model exhibited high performance in terms of the specificity and accuracy, with an extremely low rate of misclassification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.958 Â± 0.011, which further demonstrated the model accuracy. Thirteen classes were detected with an accuracy of 100% based on a confusion matrix. Nevertheless, the relatively low detection rates for the two species were likely a result of the limited number of wild-caught biological samples available. The proposed model can help establish the population densities of mosquito vectors in remote areas to predict disease outbreaks in advance.

A deep learning framework for real-time detection of novel pathogens during sequencing
Abstract: 
 Motivation Novel pathogens evolve quickly and may emerge rapidly, causing dangerous outbreaks or even global pandemics. Next-generation sequencing is the state-of-the art in open-view pathogen detection, and one of the few methods available at the earliest stages of an epidemic, even when the biological threat is unknown. Analyzing the samples as the sequencer is running can greatly reduce the turnaround time, but existing tools rely on close matches to lists of known pathogens and perform poorly on novel species. Machine learning approaches can predict if single reads originate from more distant, unknown pathogens, but require relatively long input sequences and processed data from a finished sequencing run. Results We present DeePaC-Live, a Python package for real-time pathogenic potential prediction directly from incomplete sequencing reads. We train deep neural networks to classify Illumina and Nanopore reads and integrate our models with HiLive2, a real-time Illumina mapper. DeePaC-Live outperforms alternatives based on machine learning and sequence alignment on simulated and real data, including SARS-CoV-2 sequencing runs. After just 50 Illumina cycles, we increase the true positive rate 80-fold compared to the live-mapping approach. The first 250bp of Nanopore reads, corresponding to 0.5s of sequencing time, are enough to yield predictions more accurate than mapping the finished long reads. Our approach could also be used for screening synthetic sequences against biosecurity threats. Availability The code is available at: https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/deepac-live and https://gitlab.com/dacs-hpi/deepac. The package can be installed with Bioconda, Docker or pip.

Reservoir Hosts Prediction for COVID-19 by Hybrid Transfer Learning Model
Abstract: 
 The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has infected millions of people around the world, which is leading to the global emergency. In the event of the virus outbreak, it is crucial to get the carriers of the virus timely and precisely, then the animal origins can be isolated for further infection. Traditional identifications rely on fields and laboratory researches that lag the responses to emerging epidemic prevention. With the development of machine learning, the efficiency of predicting the viral hosts has been demonstrated by recent researchers. However, the problems of the limited annotated virus data and imbalanced hosts information restrict these approaches to obtain a better result. To assure the high reliability of predicting the animal origins on COVID-19, we extend transfer learning and ensemble learning to present a hybrid transfer learning model. When predicting the hosts of newly discovered virus, our model provides a novel solution to utilize the related virus domain as auxiliary to help building a robust model for target virus domain. The simulation results on several UCI benchmarks and viral genome datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the general classical methods under the condition of limited target training sets and class-imbalance problems. By setting the coronavirus as target domain and other related virus as source domain, the feasibility of our approach is evaluated. Finally, we show the animal reservoirs prediction of the COVID-19 for further analysing.

Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data
Abstract: 
 Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. Further, we develop a suite of interpretability tools and show that it can be applied also to other models beyond the host prediction task. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect regions of interest in novel agents, for example, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All methods presented here are implemented as easy-to-install packages not only enabling analysis of NGS datasets without requiring any deep learning skills, but also allowing advanced users to easily train and explain new models for genomics.

PACIFIC: a lightweight deep-learning classifier of SARS-CoV-2 and co-infecting RNA viruses
Abstract: 
 Viral co-infections occur in COVID-19 patients, potentially impacting disease progression and severity. However, there is currently no dedicated method to identify viral co-infections in patient RNA-seq data. We developed PACIFIC, a deep-learning algorithm that accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 and other common RNA respiratory viruses from RNA-seq data. Using in silico data, PACIFIC recovers the presence and relative concentrations of viruses with > 99% precision and recall. PACIFIC accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections in 63 independent in vitro cell culture and patient datasets. PACIFIC is an end-to-end tool that enables the systematic monitoring of viral infections in the current global pandemic.
