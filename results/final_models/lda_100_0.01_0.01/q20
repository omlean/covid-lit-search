Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) COVID-19 vaccine platform
Abstract: 
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) a pandemic; from that date the vaccine race has begun, and many technology platforms to develop a specific and effective COVID-19 vaccine have been launched in several clinical trials (protein subunit, RNA-based, DNA-based, replicating viral vector, non-replicating viral vector, inactivated virus, live attenuated virus and virus-like particle). Among the next-generation strategies, nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) vaccines appear the most attractive, not only to counteract emerging pathogens, but also for the possible applications in regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. However, exactly as all innovative drugs, they deserve a careful pharmacovigilance in the short and long term. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Spotlight on the importance of recombinant vector platform technologies in poultry vaccination
Abstract: 
 The use of novel vector vaccines (viral, bacterial and apicomplexan) can have a significant impact on the control of poultry disease. They offer a cost effective, convenient and effective means of mass vaccine delivery combined with the ability to switch on both antibody and cell mediated immunity. In addition, recent viral vector constructs have enabled farmers to vaccinate against up to three important pathogens with a single in ovo administration. As the technology develops it is likely that this means of vaccine administration will be utilised further and it will play a key role in the control of both existing and new emerging diseases of poultry in the future.

Development of COVID-19 vaccines utilizing gene therapy technology
Abstract: 
 There is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Individuals with COVID-19 have symptoms that are usually asymptomatic or mild in most initial cases. However, in some cases, moderate and severe symptoms have been observed with pneumonia. Many companies are developing COVID-19 vaccine candidates using different technologies that are classified into four groups (intact target viruses, proteins, viral vectors and nucleic acids). For rapid development, RNA vaccines and adenovirus vector vaccines have been urgently approved, and their injection has already started across the world. These types of vaccine technologies have been developed over more than 20 years using translational research for use against cancer or diseases caused by genetic disorders but the COVID-19 vaccines are the first licensed drugs to prevent infectious diseases using RNA vaccine technology. Although these vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19 for a short period, safety and efficiency evaluations should be continuously monitored over a long time period. As the time of writing, more than 10 projects are now in phase 3 to evaluate the prevention of infection in double-blind studies. Hopefully, several projects may be approved to ensure high-efficiency and safe vaccines.

Using an effective TB vaccination regimen to identify immune responses associated with protection in the murine model
Abstract: 
 A vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), a disease resulting from infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is urgently needed to prevent more than a million deaths per year. Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) is the only available vaccine against TB but its efficacy varies throughout the world. Subunit vaccine candidates, based on recombinant viral vectors expressing mycobacterial antigens, are one of the strategies being developed to boost BCG-primed host immune responses and efficacy. A promising vaccination regimen composed of intradermal (i.d.) BCG prime, followed by intranasally (i.n.) administered chimpanzee adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1) and i.n. or i.d. modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA), both expressing Ag85A, has been previously reported to significantly improve BCG efficacy in mice. Effector and memory immune responses induced by BCG-ChAdOx1.85A-MVA85A (B-C-M), were evaluated to identify immune correlates of protection in mice. This protective regime induced strong Ag85A-specific cytokine responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, both in the systemic and pulmonary compartments. Lung parenchymal CXCR3+ KLRG1- Ag85A-specific memory CD4+ T cells were significantly increased in B-C-M compared to BCG immunised mice at 4, 8 and 20 weeks post vaccination, but the number of these cells decreased at the latter time point. This cell population was associated with the protective efficacy of this regime and may have an important protective role against M.tb infection.
