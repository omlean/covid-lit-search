IBD Systems Biology Is Here to Stay
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND Systems biology is a rapidly advancing field of science that allows us to look into disease mechanisms, patient diagnosis and stratification, and drug development in a completely new light. It is based on the utilization of unbiased computational systems free of the traditional experimental approaches based on personal choices of what is important and what select experiments should be performed to obtain the expected results. METHODS Systems biology can be applied to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by learning basic concepts of omes and omics and how omics-derived "big data" can be integrated to discover the biological networks underlying highly complex diseases like IBD. Once these biological networks (interactomes) are identified, then the molecules controlling the disease network can be singled out and specific blockers developed. RESULTS The field of systems biology in IBD is just emerging, and there is still limited information on how to best utilize its power to advance our understanding of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Few centers have embraced systems biology in IBD, but the creation of international consortia and large biobanks will make biosamples available to basic and clinical IBD investigators for further research studies. CONCLUSIONS The implementation of systems biology is indispensable and unavoidable, and the patient and medical communities will both benefit immensely from what it will offer in the near future.
