COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Scales: Factor Structure and Initial Psychometrics
Abstract: 
 OBJECTIVE In response to the rapidly unfolding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in spring 2020, we developed a caregiver-report measure to understand the extent to which children and families were exposed to events related to COVID-19 and their perceptions of its impact. This article reports on the factor structure and psychometric properties of this measure. METHODS The COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Scales (CEFIS) were developed by a multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team using a rapid iterative process. Data from 1805 caregivers recruited from 28 programs at 15 institutions across the United States were collected from May-September 2020. We examined the underlying structure of the CEFIS using exploratory factor analyses and its internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha). RESULTS Participants reported a range of COVID-19-related events (M = 8.71 events of 25). On the bidirectional 4-point impact scale, mean scores were mostly above the midpoint, indicating a slightly negative impact. Cronbach's alpha was excellent for Exposure (α = .80) and Impact (α = .92). Factor analysis identified six factors for Exposure (COVID-19 experiences, Access to essentials, Disruptions to living conditions, Loss of income, Family caregiving and activities, and Designation as an essential worker). There were three factors for Impact (Personal well-being, Family interactions, and Distress). DISCUSSION The CEFIS has strong factors assessing Exposure to events related to COVID-19, and the Impact of these events on families of children in pediatric healthcare. These initial validation data support use of the CEFIS for measuring the effect of the pandemic.

Clinical spectrum and outcome of patients visiting coronavirus screening centre in North India and clinical predictors for COVID-19
Abstract: 
 Aim: The aim of this study is to elucidate the demographics, symptoms and outcome of sick persons visiting coronavirus (COVID) screening OPD of a tertiary institute in North India Study Design: The present descriptive, prospective study was done on 1030 patients and information about presenting symptoms, demographics (age, sex, nationality, residence), contact and travel history, comorbidities etc , were recorded On the basis of criteria given by Indian Council of Medical Research, patients were divided into suspected (SARS-CoV-2) and non-suspected group Of the suspected patients, with RT-PCR test positive were classified as confirmed COVID-19 case and negative RT-PCR symptomatic individual were defined as negative COVID-19 case

Tracking of COVID-19 geographical infections on real-time tweets
Abstract: 
 Coronavirus COVID-19 is a global pandemic stated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2020 The COVID-19 devastating impact was not only affect human life but also many aspects of it such as social interaction, transportation options, personal saving and expenses, and more The power of social media data in such world pandemic outbreaks provides an efficient source of tracking, raising awareness, and alerts with potentials infection location Social networks can fight the pandemic by sharing helpful content and statistics based on demographics features of users around the world There is an urgent need for such frameworks for tracking helpful content, detecting misleading content, ranking the trusted user content, presenting accurate demographics statistics of the outbreak In this paper, the real-time tweets of Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) analysis will be presented The proposed framework will be used to track the geographical infections, trends of the content, and the user’s categorization The framework will include analysis, demographics features, statistical charts, classifying the content of tweets related to its usefulness The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated based on different measures such as classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity Finally, a set of recommendations will be presented to benefit from the proposed framework with its full potentials as a tool to stand against the COVID-19 spreading © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG

Evolution of Pathology Patterns in Persons Who Died From COVID-19 in Italy: A National Study Based on Death Certificates
Abstract: 
 Background: In Italy, during the first epidemic wave of 2020, the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality was reached at the end of March. Afterward, a progressive reduction was observed until much lower figures were reached during the summer, resulting from the contained circulation of SARS-CoV-2. This study aimed to determine if and how the pathological patterns of the individuals deceased from COVID-19 changed during the phases of epidemic waves in terms of: (i) main cause of death, (ii) comorbidities, and (iii) complications related to death. Methods: Death certificates of persons who died and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, provided by the National Surveillance system, were coded according to ICD rev10. Deaths due to COVID-19 were defined as those in which COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death. Results: The percentage of COVID-19 deaths varied over time. It decreased in the downward phase of the epidemic curve (76.6 vs. 88.7%). In February–April 2020, hypertensive heart disease was mentioned as a comorbidity in 18.5% of death certificates, followed by diabetes (15.9% of cases), ischemic heart disease (13.1%), and neoplasms (12.1%). In May–September, the most frequent comorbidity was neoplasms (17.3% of cases), followed by hypertensive heart disease (14.9%), diabetes (14.8%), and dementia/Alzheimer's disease (11.9%). The most mentioned complications in both periods were pneumonia and respiratory failure with a frequency far higher than any other condition (78.4% in February–April 2020 and 63.7% in May–September 2020). Discussion: The age of patients dying from COVID-19 and their disease burden increased in the May–September 2020 period. A more serious disease burden was observed in this period, with a significantly higher frequency of chronic pathologies. Our study suggests better control of the virus' lethality in the second phase of the epidemic, when the health system was less burdened. Moreover, COVID-19 care protocols had been created in hospitals, and knowledge about the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 had improved, potentially leading to more accurate diagnosis and better treatment. All these factors may have improved survival in patients with COVID-19 and led to a shift in mortality to older, more vulnerable, and complex patients.

Making a COVID-19 vaccine that works for everyone: ensuring equity and inclusivity in clinical trials
Abstract: 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mortality and morbidity have been shown to increase with deprivation and impact non-White ethnicities more severely. Despite the extra risk Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) groups face in the pandemic, our current medical research system seems to prioritise innovation aimed at people of European descent. We found significant difficulties in assessing baseline demographics in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, displaying a lack of transparency in reporting. Further, we found that most of these trials take place in high-income countries, with only 25 of 219 trials (11.4%) taking place in lower middle- or low-income countries. Trials for the current best vaccine candidates (BNT162b2, ChadOx1, mRNA-173) recruited 80.0% White participants. Underrepresentation of BAME groups in medical research will perpetuate historical distrust in healthcare processes, and poses a risk of unknown differences in efficacy and safety of these vaccines by phenotype. Limiting trial demographics and settings will mean a lack of global applicability of the results of COVID-19 vaccine trials, which will slow progress towards ending the pandemic.
