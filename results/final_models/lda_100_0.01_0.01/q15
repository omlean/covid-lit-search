Neutrophil and Eosinophil DNA Extracellular Trap Formation: Lessons From Pathogenic Fungi
Abstract: 
 Fungal infections represent a worldwide health problem. Fungal pathogens are responsible for a variety of conditions, including superficial diseases, allergic pathologies and potentially lethal invasive infections. Neutrophils and eosinophils have been implicated as effector cells in several pathologies. Neutrophils are major effector cells involved in the control of fungal infections and exhibit a plethora of antifungal mechanisms, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, degranulation, extracellular vesicle formation, and DNA extracellular trap (ET) release. Eosinophils are polymorphonuclear cells classically implicated as effector cells in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and helminthic infections, although their roles as immunomodulatory players in both innate and adaptive immunity are currently recognized. Eosinophils are also endowed with antifungal activities and are abundantly found in allergic conditions associated with fungal colonization and sensitization. Neutrophils and eosinophils have been demonstrated to release their nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in response to many pathogens and pro-inflammatory stimuli. ETs have been implicated in the killing and control of many pathogens, as well as in promoting inflammation and tissue damage. The formation of ETs by neutrophils and eosinophils has been described in response to pathogenic fungi. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms involved in the release of neutrophil and eosinophil ETs in response to fungal pathogens. General implications for understanding the formation of ETs and the roles of ETs in fungal infections are discussed.

The Balance of Neutrophil Extracellular Trap Formation and Nuclease Degradation: an Unknown Role of Bacterial Coinfections in COVID-19 Patients
Abstract: 
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is leading to public health crises worldwide. An understanding of the pathogenesis and the development of treatment strategies is of high interest. Recently, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been identified as a potential driver of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans. NETs are extracellular DNA fibers released by neutrophils after contact with various stimuli and accumulate antimicrobial substances or host defense peptides. When massively released, NETs are described to contribute to immunothrombosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome and in vascular occlusions. Based on the increasing evidence that NETs contribute to severe COVID-19 cases, DNase treatment of COVID-19 patients to degrade NETs is widely discussed as a potential therapeutic strategy. Here, we discuss potential detrimental effects of NETs and their nuclease degradation, since NET fragments can boost certain bacterial coinfections and thereby increase the severity of the disease.

Role of Toll-like receptors in the pathogenesis of COVID-19
Abstract: 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a pandemic since March 2020. The exact pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of each component of the innate and adaptive immune system is still unknown. However, available data from other coronavirus families, such as SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome and also new findings could be useful for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2. Toll-like receptors (TLR) play an important role in recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system. Activation of TLR pathways leads to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, as well as type 1 interferon. Different TLRs, like TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are potentially important in COVID-19 infection. It is also worth mentioning that we should bear in mind both the beneficial and harmful effects of TLR in confronting COVID-19 infection. TLRs could be a potential target in controlling the infection in the early stages of disease and production of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

Phosphatases in toll-like receptors signaling: the unfairly-forgotten
Abstract: 
 ABSTRACT: Over the past 2 decades, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been shown to be on the front line of many illnesses such as autoimmune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases as well as allergies and cancer. Among PRRs, toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the most studied family. Dissecting TLRs signaling turned out to be advantageous to elaborate efficient treatments to cure autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders. However, a broad understanding of TLR effectors is required to propose a better range of cures. In addition to kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases, phosphatases emerge as important regulators of TLRs signaling mediated by NF-κB, type I interferons (IFN I) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases signaling pathways. Here, we review recent knowledge on TLRs signaling modulation by different classes and subclasses of phosphatases. Thus, it becomes more and more evident that phosphatases could represent novel therapeutic targets to control pathogenic TLRs signaling. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: [Image: see text]

Neutrophil Extracellular Traps: New Aspects
Abstract: 
 Neutrophils are the “first line” of defense against pathogens in the locus of inflammation, where they use effector functions such as phagocytosis, degranulation, and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In 2004, Artuto Zychlinsky characterized one more neutrophil effector function—the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (or NETs). NETs are a modified chromatin “decorated” by bactericidal proteins of granules, nucleus, and cytoplasm. The release of NETs can be activated by diverse physiological and pharmacological stimuli and depends on ROS, for which NADPH oxidase is the main source. In the process of NET formation, the release of bactericidal components of granules into the cytoplasm, modification of histones leading to chromatin decondensation, destruction of the nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic membrane with the involvement of gasdermin D protein, and, finally, the release of chromatin outside the cell occurs. At the same time, uncontrolled formation of NETs is a provoking factor in the development of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. NETs were found at autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and vasculitis; NETs are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and oncological diseases. In this review, the main ideas about the mechanisms of NET formation, as well as their role in physiological processes and pathogenesis of a number of diseases (including COVID-19), are discussed.
