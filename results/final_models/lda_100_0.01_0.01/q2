The ROX index can be a useful tool for the triage evaluation of COVID-19 patients with dyspnoea
Abstract: 
 AIM To assess whether the application of a non-invasive tool, such as ratio of oxygen saturation (ROX) index, during triage can identify patients with COVID-19 at high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). DESIGN A multi-centre, observational, retrospective study. METHODS Only COVID-19 positive patients who required an emergency department evaluation for dyspnoea were considered. The primary objective of the study was to compare the ROX value obtained during triage with the medical diagnosis of ARDS and intubation in 72 h of the triage evaluation. The ROX index value was also compared with objective outcomes, such as the pressure of arterial O2 (PaO2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2 ) ratio and the lung parenchyma volume involved in COVID-19-related inflammatory processes, based on 3D reconstructions of chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS During the study period, from 20 March 2020 until 31 May 2020, a total of 273 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. The predictive ability of ROX for the risk of developing ARDS in 72 h after triage evaluation was associated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.845 (0.797-0.892, p < 0.001), whereas the AUROC value was 0.727 (0.634-0.821, p < 0.001) for the risk of intubation. ROX values were strongly correlated with PaO2 /FiO2 values (r = 0.650, p < 0.001), decreased ROX values were associated with increased percentages of lung involvement based on 3D CT reconstruction (r = -0.371, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The ROX index showed a good ability to identify triage patients at high evolutionary risk. Correlations with objective but more invasive indicators (PaO2 /FiO2 and CT) confirmed the important role of ROX in identifying COVID-19 patients with extensive pathological processes. IMPACT During the difficult triage evaluation of COVID-19 patients, the ROX index can help the nurse to identify the real severity of the patient. The triage systems could integrate the ROX in the rapid patient assessment to stratify patients more accurately.

Prone position ventilation and femoro-femoral veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for COVID-19 treatment
Abstract: 
 Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide Approximately 5% of COVID-19 patients who suffer from pneumonia develop critical respiratory failure Here, we report the case of a healthy 52-year-old man who had respiratory failure owing to SARS-CoV-2 infection and was treated using femoro-femoral veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) and prone position ventilation (PPV) After this treatment, his blood oxygen levels, chest high-resolution computed tomography findings, and clinical parameters significantly improved He was decannulated from VV-ECMO on day 6 and finally extubated on day 11 To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome that was successfully treated with a combination of femoro-femoral VV-ECMO and PPV

Lung Ultrasound for Identification of Patients Requiring Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in COVID-19
Abstract: 
 OBJECTIVES: Indication for invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 pneumonia has been a major challenge. This study aimed to evaluate if lung ultrasound (LUS) can assist identification of requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 23 and November 12, 2020, hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (oxygen demand &#8805;4 L/min) were included consecutively. Lung ultrasound was performed daily until invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV-group) or spontaneous recovery (non-IMV-group). Clinical parameters and lung ultrasound findings were compared between groups, at intubation (IMV-group) and highest oxygen demand (non-IMV-group). A reference group with oxygen demand <4 L/min was examined at hospital admission. RESULTS: Altogether 72 patients were included: 50 study patients (IMV-group, n = 23; non-IMV-group, n = 27) and 22 reference patients. LUS-score correlated to oxygen demand (SpO2 /FiO2 -ratio) (r = 0.728; p < 0.0001) and was higher in the IMV-group compared to the non-IMV-group (20.0 versus 18.0; p = 0.026). Based on receiver operating characteristic analysis, a LUS-score of 19.5 was identified as cut-off for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation (area under the curve 0.68; sensitivity 56%, specificity 74%). In 6 patients, LUS identified critical coexisting conditions. Respiratory rate and oxygenation index ((SpO2 /FiO2 )/respiratory rate) &#8805;4.88 identified no requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation with a positive predictive value of 87% and negative predictive value of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: LUS-score had only a moderate diagnostic value for requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation in moderate to severe COVID-19. However, LUS proved valuable as complement to respiratory parameters in guidance of disease severity and identifying critical coexisting conditions.

Subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum in patients with COVID-19 disease; case series from a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan
Abstract: 
 Since December 2019, the clinical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications are evolving. As the number of COVID patients requiring positive pressure ventilation is increasing, so is the incidence of subcutaneous emphysema (SE). We report 10 patients of COVID-19, with SE and pneumomediastinum. The mean age of the patients was 59 ± 8 years (range, 23–75). Majority of them were men (80%), and common symptoms were dyspnoea (100%), fever (80%) and cough (80%). None of them had any underlying lung disorder. All patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome on admission, with a median PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of 122.5. Eight out of ten patients had spontaneous pneumomediastinum on their initial chest x-ray in the emergency department. The median duration of assisted ventilation before the development of SE was 5.5 days (interquartile range, 5–10 days). The highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was 10 cmH(2)O for patients recieving invasive mechanical ventilation, while 8 cmH(2)O was the average PEEP in patients who had developed subcutaneous emphysema on non-invasive ventilation. All patients received corticosteroids while six also received tocilizumab, and seven received convalescent plasma therapy, respectively. Seven patients died during their hospital stay. All patients either survivor or non-survivor had prolonged hospital stay with an average of 14 days (range 8−25 days). Our findings suggest that it is lung damage secondary to inflammatory response due to COVID-19 triggered by the use of positive pressure ventilation which resulted in this complication. We conclude that the development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum and SE whenever present, is associated with poor outcome in critically ill COVID-19 ARDS patients.

Transpulmonary pressure measurements and lung mechanics in patients with early ARDS and SARS-CoV-2
Abstract: 
 PURPOSE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has demonstrated variable oxygenation and respiratory-system mechanics without investigation of transpulmonary and chest-wall mechanics. This case series describes lung, chest wall and respiratory-system mechanics in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS. METHODS: Data was collected from forty patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and ARDS at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. Esophageal balloons were placed to estimate pleural and transpulmonary pressures. Clinical characteristics, respiratory-system, transpulmonary, and chest-wall mechanics were measured over the first week. RESULTS: Patients had moderate-severe ARDS (PaO(2)/FiO(2) 123[98–149]) and were critically ill (APACHE IV 108 [94–128] and SOFA 12 [11–13]). PaO(2)/FiO(2) improved over the first week (150 mmHg [122.9–182] to 185 mmHg [138–228] (p = 0.035)). Respiratory system (30–35 ml/cm H(2)O), lung (40–50 ml/cm H(2)O) and chest wall (120–150 ml/cm H(2)O) compliance remained similar over the first week. Elevated basal pleural pressures correlated with BMI. Patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation (14.5 days [9.5–19.0]), with a mortality of 32.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients displayed normal chest-wall mechanics, with increased basal pleural pressure. Respiratory system and lung mechanics were similar to known existing ARDS cohorts. The wide range of respiratory system mechanics illustrates the inherent heterogeneity that is consistent with typical ARDS.
