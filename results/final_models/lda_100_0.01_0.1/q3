The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Physician-Pharmaceutical Office-Based Interactions
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND COVID-19 has had significant negative economic ramifications on dermatologic care delivery, including curtailing live on-site physician-pharmaceutical-representative interactions (PPRI). OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic regulations on current and future PPRI. METHODS Cross-sectional survey-based study that analyzed data from 400 surveyed dermatologists using a pre-validated questionnaire sent via email. Data regarding PPRI were collected over 1 week in July 2020 to compare demographics and practice standards from April 2019, April 2020, July 2020, and predictions for 2021. RESULTS Virtual-only PPRI increased from 7.8% in April 2019 to 26.5% during April 2020 (mean difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6%–23.9%). Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3. LIMITATIONS Relatively small sample size, especially among subgroups. Responses may have been retrospective estimates. There may also be selection bias given slightly increased representation of more experienced dermatologists. CONCLUSION PPRI materially decreased during the initial COVID-19 peak but will likely return to baseline volume moving forward with a significant component being hybrid PPRI. Further studies may better elucidate the economic and clinical impact associated with these changes and their effect on dermatologists’ ability to provide patients with samples and educational materials.

Impact of COVID-19 on U.S. Hospitals and Patients, April - July 2020
Abstract: 
 OBJECTIVE: The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout key regions of the United States (U.S.) in early 2020 placed a premium on timely, national surveillance of hospital patient censuses. To meet that need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the nation's largest hospital surveillance system, launched a module for collecting hospital COVID-19 data. This paper presents time series estimates of the critical hospital capacity indicators during April 1-July 14, 2020. DESIGN: From March 27-July 14, 2020, NHSN collected daily data on hospital bed occupancy, number of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and availability/use of mechanical ventilators. Time series were constructed using multiple imputation and survey weighting to allow near real-time daily national and state estimates to be computed. RESULTS: During the pandemic's April peak in the United States, among an estimated 431,000 total inpatients, 84,000 (19%) had COVID-19. Although the number of inpatients with COVID-19 decreased during April to July, the proportion of occupied inpatient beds increased steadily. COVID-19 hospitalizations increased from mid-June in the South and Southwest after stay-at-home restrictions were eased. The proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 on ventilators decreased from April to July. CONCLUSIONS: The NHSN hospital capacity estimates served as important, near-real time indicators of the pandemic's magnitude, spread, and impact, providing quantitative guidance for the public health response. Use of the estimates detected the rise of hospitalizations in specific geographic regions in June after declining from a peak in April. Patient outcomes appeared to improve from early April to mid-July.

Orthopaedic Trauma Theatre Efficiency in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Are We Returning to Normality
Abstract: 
 Background Recent studies have shown a decline in theatre efficiency and productivity coinciding with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, we evaluate trauma theatre task efficiency in three different time periods (April 2019, April 2020, and November 2020), and analyse if productivity has altered since the start of the pandemic. Methods The records of a total of 320 patients who underwent orthopaedic trauma surgery at a large district general hospital in April 2019, April 2020 (during the first wave of the pandemic) and November 2020 (during the second wave of the pandemic) were analysed. Primary outcomes measured include time to get to the theatre, anaesthetic preparation time, the sum of time of anaesthesia and surgical preparation time, duration of surgery and time to transfer to recovery. Patient demographics as well as the type of surgery were also analysed. Results The time to get to the theatre and anaesthetic preparation time significantly increased in April 2020 (p<0.05) but fell in November 2020 with no significant difference in comparison to before the pandemic in April 2019 (p>0.05). The duration of surgery and time to transfer to recovery significantly increased in April 2020 (p<0.05) and though reduced in November 2020, was still significantly greater in comparison to April 2019 (p<0.05). In April 2020, the proportion of patients aged 18-65 was just 26% as compared to 35% in April 2019. This figure rose again to 45% in November 2020. The number of hip fracture procedures remained similar during the three time periods, with 32, 32 and 36 hip fracture operations in April 2019, April 2020 and November 2020, respectively. Conclusion While operating theatres' efficiency decreased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it increased again in the second wave, coming close to the ‘normal’ levels before the pandemic struck.
