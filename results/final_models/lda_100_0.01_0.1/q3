QOL assessment after palliative surgery for malignant bowel obstruction caused by peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer: a prospective multicenter observational study
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND Patients with peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer have poor oral intake caused by malignant bowel obstruction (MBO). Palliative surgery has often been undertaken to improve quality of life (QOL), but few prospective studies on palliative surgery in this patient population have been published. PATIENTS AND METHODS We prospectively investigated the significance of palliative surgery using patient-reported QOL measures. Patients underwent palliative surgery by small intestine/colon resection or small intestine/colon bypass or ileostomy/colostomy for MBO. The primary endpoint was change in QOL assessed at baseline, 14 days, 1 month, and 3 months following palliative surgery using the Euro QoL Five Dimensions (EQ-5D™) questionnaire and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire gastric cancer module (QLQ-STO22). Secondary endpoints were postoperative improvement in oral intake and surgical complications. RESULTS Between April 2013 and March 2018, 63 patients were enrolled from 14 institutions. The mean EQ-5D™ utility index baseline score of 0.6 remained consistent. Gastric-specific symptoms mostly showed statistically significant improvement from baseline. Forty-two patients (67%) were able to eat solid food 2 weeks after palliative surgery and 36 patients (57%) tolerated it for 3 months. The rate of overall morbidity of ≥ grade III according to the Clavien-Dindo classification was 16% (10 patients) and the 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 3.2% (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS In patients with MBO caused by peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer, palliative surgery did not improve QOL while improving solid food intake, with an acceptable postoperative morbidity and mortality rate.

Management of patients with colorectal cancer in COVID-19 pandemic hospital
Abstract: 
 INTRODUCTION During the COVID-19 pandemic, both the channelling of manpower into the COVID-19 services and efforts to limit viral spreading of the disease have led to rescheduling and prioritizing oncological cases that are considered as cases of emergency and any postponement of the cases can lead to health problems. In this study, we aimed to show that the surgical treatment of COVID-19 (-) colorectal cancer patients can be performed in a hospital which was declared as a pandemic hospital. METHOD In our study, we included patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in the general surgery clinic between the dates 03.20.2020 and 05.20.2020, when the hospital was declared COVID-19 pandemic hospital. Emergency colorectal cancer surgeries such as ileus and perforation were excluded from the study. RESULTS While in the status of pandemic hospital, 80 COVID-19 (+) and 563 COVID-19 (+) suspicious patients were treated. Between 10 March 2020 and 15 May 2020, 12 colorectal cancer patients were operated in the General Surgery Clinic of BAIBU Faculty of Medicine, as well. CONCLUSION We think that with our study we have shown that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the surgical treatment can be performed for patients with colorectal cancer by eliminating COVID-19 suspicions (Tab. 1, Ref. 14).

The impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the surgical management of gynecological cancers: Analysis of the multicenter database of the French SCGP and the FRANCOGYN group
Abstract: 
 INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has put tremendous pressure on the French healthcare system. Almost all hospital departments have had to profoundly modify their activity to cope with the crisis. In this context, the surgical management of cancers has been a topic of debate as care strategies were tailored to avoid any delay in treatment that could be detrimental to patient wellbeing while being careful not to overload intensive care units. The primary objective of this study was to observe changes in the surgical management of pelvic cancers during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study analyzed data from the prospective multi-center cohort study conducted by the French Society for Pelvic and Gynecological Surgery (SCGP) with methodological support from the French (FRANCOGYN) Group. All members of the SCGP received by e-mail a link allowing them to include patients who were scheduled to undergo gynecological carcinologic surgery between March 16th 2020 and May 11th 2020. Demographic data, the characteristics of cancers and the impact of the crisis in terms of changes to the usual recommended coarse of care were collected. RESULTS: A total of 181 patients with a median age 63 years were included in the cohort. In total, 31 patients had cervical cancer, 76 patients had endometrial cancer, 52 patients had ovarian or tubal cancer, 5 patients had a borderline tumor of the ovary, and 17 patients had vulvar cancer. During the study period, the care strategy was changed for 49 (27%) patients with postponed for 35 (19.3%) patients, and canceled for 7 (3.9%) patients. Surgical treatment was maintained for 139 (76.8%) patients. Management with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was offered to 19 (10,5%) patients and a change in surgical choice was made for 5 (2,8%) patients. In total, 8 (4,4%) patients tested positive for COVID-19. Data also shows a greater number of therapeutic changes in cases of ovarian cancer as well as a cancelation of a lumbo-aortic lymphadenectomy in one patient with cervical cancer. Hospital consultants estimated a direct detrimental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for 39 patients, representing 22% of gynecological cancers. CONCLUSION: This study provided observational data of the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on the surgical management of gynecological cancers.

Delayed presentation of head and neck cancer patients during COVID-19 pandemic
Abstract: 
 PURPOSE: Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare is huge. We intended to demonstrate how COVID-19 pandemic affected primary head and neck oncology patient’s referral and admission to a tertiary center by comparing the retrospective patient data in March–September 2020 and the same period in 2019. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, from March 15th, 2020 to September 15th, 2020, medical records of 61 patients (Group 1) diagnosed and scheduled for surgery for head and neck cancer in our tertiary care center were revised and compared with 64 head and neck cancer patients treated in the same institution in the same time period of the previous year (Group2). Surgical site, TNM stages, need for reconstruction with flap, time from first symptom occurrence to first admission to our institution, and time to surgery were noted. RESULTS: In Group 1, out of 56 patients, 26 were diagnosed with T1-2 tumor, while 30 had T3-4 tumor. In Group 2, 43 of 60 patients had T1-2 tumor, while only 17 of them were diagnosed with T3-4 tumor. The rate of T3-4 tumors had significantly increased in 2020 when compared to 2019 (p = 0.049). In oral cavity cancer patients, N stage was significantly increased in Group 1 when compared to Group 2 (p = 0.024). Need for reconstruction with regional or free flaps were significantly increased in oral cavity cancer patients (p = 0,022). The mean time from the beginning of the first symptom to the admission was 19.01 ± 4.6 weeks (ranging between 11 and 32 weeks) in Group 1, while it was 16.6 ± 5.9 weeks in Group 2 (ranging between 6 and18 weeks); with significant increase (p = 0,02). The time to surgery from first admission was 3.4 ± 2.5 and 2.9 ± 1.2 weeks in Group 1 and 2, respectively, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.06). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused delay in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases as such in head and neck cancers. Admission with advanced stage disease and the need for more complex reconstructive procedures were increased. During the pandemic, the management of other diseases that cause mortality and morbidity should not be neglected and priorities should be determined.
