Bahraini Public’s Dependency on Social Media as a Source of Information About COVID-19 Pandemic
Abstract: 
 This study aims to identify the role of media campaigns factors to combat Corona Virus (COVID-19) in the Kingdom of Bahrain applying to a simple random sample of 250 through questionnaire tool. The results showed the campaigns focused on many ways to prevent the disease, namely: washing hands frequently with soap and water, using disinfectants to clean the house, using tissues when coughing or sneezing, ventilating the house constantly the campaigns showed also many indicators of Corona Virus infection such as high temperature in all body parts, and severe coughing.

Fisher Information of Free-Electron Landau States
Abstract: 
 An electron in a constant magnetic field has energy levels, known as the Landau levels. One can obtain the corresponding radial wavefunction of free-electron Landau states in cylindrical polar coordinates. However, this system has not been explored so far in terms of an information-theoretical viewpoint. Here, we focus on Fisher information associated with these Landau states specified by the two quantum numbers. Fisher information provides a useful measure of the electronic structure in quantum systems, such as hydrogen-like atoms and under some potentials. By numerically evaluating the generalized Laguerre polynomials in the radial densities, we report that Fisher information increases linearly with the principal quantum number that specifies energy levels, but decreases monotonically with the azimuthal quantum number m. We also present relative Fisher information of the Landau states against the reference density with [Formula: see text] , which is proportional to the principal quantum number. We compare it with the case when the lowest Landau level state is set as the reference.

A Systematic Scoping Review of Media Campaigns to Develop a Typology to Evaluate Their Collective Impact on Promoting Healthy Hydration Behaviors and Reducing Sugary Beverage Health Risks
Abstract: 
 Interventions to discourage sugary beverages and encourage water consumption have produced modest and unsustainable behavioral changes to reduce obesity and noncommunicable disease risks. This systematic scoping review examined media campaigns to develop a typology to support healthy hydration nonalcoholic beverage behaviors. Our three-step methodology included the following: (1) review and summarize expert-recommended healthy beverage guidelines; (2) review six English-language electronic databases guided by PRISMA to describe existing campaign types by issue, goal and underlying theory; and (3) develop a media campaign typology to support policies, systems and environments to encourage healthy hydration behaviors. Results showed no international consensus for healthy beverage guidelines, though we describe expert-recommended healthy beverage guidelines for the United States. Of 909 records identified, we included 24 articles describing distinct media campaigns and nine sources that defined models, schemes or taxonomies. The final media campaign typology included: (1) corporate advertising, marketing or entertainment; (2) corporate social responsibility, public relations/cause marketing; (3) social marketing; (4) public information, awareness, education/ health promotion; (5) media advocacy/countermarketing; and (6) political or public policy. This proof-of-concept media campaign typology can be used to evaluate their collective impact and support for a social change movement to reduce sugary beverage health risks and to encourage healthy hydration behaviors.

Early Crowdfunding Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Study
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND: As the number of COVID-19 cases increased precipitously in the United States, policy makers and health officials marshalled their pandemic responses. As the economic impacts multiplied, anecdotal reports noted the increased use of web-based crowdfunding to defray these costs. OBJECTIVE: We examined the web-based crowdfunding response in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States to understand the incidence of initiation of COVID-19–related campaigns and compare them to non–COVID-19–related campaigns. METHODS: On May 16, 2020, we extracted all available data available on US campaigns that contained narratives and were created between January 1 and May 10, 2020, on GoFundMe. We identified the subset of COVID-19–related campaigns using keywords relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. We explored the incidence of COVID-19–related campaigns by geography, by category, and over time, and we compared the characteristics of the campaigns to those of non–COVID-19–related campaigns after March 11, when the pandemic was declared. We then used a natural language processing algorithm to cluster campaigns by narrative content using overlapping keywords. RESULTS: We found that there was a substantial increase in overall GoFundMe web-based crowdfunding campaigns in March, largely attributable to COVID-19–related campaigns. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persisted and progressed, the number of campaigns per COVID-19 case declined more than tenfold across all states. The states with the earliest disease burden had the fewest campaigns per case, indicating a lack of a case-dependent response. COVID-19–related campaigns raised more money, had a longer narrative description, and were more likely to be shared on Facebook than other campaigns in the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Web-based crowdfunding appears to be a stopgap for only a minority of campaigners. The novelty of an emergency likely impacts both campaign initiation and crowdfunding success, as it reflects the affective response of a community. Crowdfunding activity likely serves as an early signal for emerging needs and societal sentiment for communities in acute distress that could be used by governments and aid organizations to guide disaster relief and policy.
