Effects of partially automated driving on the development of driver sleepiness
Abstract: 
 The objective of this study was to compare the development of sleepiness during manual driving versus level 2 partially automated driving, when driving on a motorway in Sweden. The hypothesis was that partially automated driving will lead to higher levels of fatigue due to underload. Eighty-nine drivers were included in the study using a 2 × 2 design with the conditions manual versus partially automated driving and daytime (full sleep) versus night-time (sleep deprived). The results showed that night-time driving led to markedly increased levels of sleepiness in terms of subjective sleepiness ratings, blink durations, PERCLOS, pupil diameter and heart rate. Partially automated driving led to slightly higher subjective sleepiness ratings, longer blink durations, decreased pupil diameter, slower heart rate, and higher EEG alpha and theta activity. However, elevated levels of sleepiness mainly arose from the night-time drives when the sleep pressure was high. During daytime, when the drivers were alert, partially automated driving had little or no detrimental effects on driver fatigue. Whether the negative effects of increased sleepiness during partially automated driving can be compensated by the positive effects of lateral and longitudinal driving support needs to be investigated in further studies.

Effectively Conducting Oncology Clinical Trials during the COVID-19 Pandemic
Abstract: 
 INTRODUCTION: Clinical trial enrollment has declined globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This underscores the importance of structured methods to continue critical medical research safely and efficiently. METHODS: We report the impact of a phased trial reopening strategy, remote research staffing, and telemedicine on cancer trial enrollment at one of the largest Radiation Oncology academic cancer centers. In Phase 1, trials investigating definitive therapeutic benefit were opened, followed by trials not increasing patient exposure or pulmonary toxicity risk in Phase 2. During Phase 2.5, multicenter trials reopened and limited research staff were allowed on-site. RESULTS: Despite initial enrollment declines during the early pandemic, the percentage of new patients enrolling in clinical trials from March to August 2020 was 8.8%, and represented an 10.5% relative increase from 2019. Monthly accrual enrollment from March to August 2019 ranged from 42-71 compared to enrollment during COVID-19 from 23-73 patients (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Through a phased approach to trial reopening and adaptive techniques, the Division of Radiation Oncology maintained cancer trial accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The experience may help centers maintain accrual, preserve clinical trial integrity, and minimize risk to patients and staff.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 prevalence in 1170 asymptomatic Norwegian conscripts
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND: Accurate estimates of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in different population groups are important for the health authorities. In Norway, public infection control measures have successfully curbed the pandemic. However, military training and service are incompatible with these measures; therefore extended infection control measures were implemented in the Norwegian Armed Forces. We aimed to describe these measures, discuss their value, and investigate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) prevalence and seroprevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2, as well as changes in antibody titer levels over the 6‐week military training period in a young, asymptomatic population of conscripts. METHODS: In April 2020, 1170 healthy conscripts (median age 20 years) enrolled in military training. Extended infection control measures included a pre‐enrollment telephone interview, self‐imposed quarantine, questionnaires, and serial SARS‐CoV‐2 testing. At enrollment, questionnaires were used to collect information on symptoms, and SARS‐CoV‐2 rapid antibody testing was conducted. Serial SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR and serology testing were used to estimate the prevalence of confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 and monitor titer levels at enrollment, and 3 and 6 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: At enrollment, only 0.2% of conscripts were SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR‐positive, and seroprevalence was 0.6%. Serological titer levels increased nearly 5‐fold over the 6‐week observation period. Eighteen conscripts reported mild respiratory symptoms during the 2 weeks prior to enrollment (all were PCR‐negative; one was serology‐positive), whereas 17 conscripts reported respiratory symptoms and nine had fever at enrollment (all were PCR‐ and serology‐negative). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 was less than 1% in our sample of healthy Norwegian conscripts. Testing of asymptomatic conscripts seems of no value in times of low COVID‐19 prevalence. SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody titer levels increased substantially over time in conscripts with mild symptoms.

Challenges and Adaptation of a European Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Study Platform in Response to the COVID-19 Emergence: Experience from the DRIVE Project
Abstract: 
 The Development of Robust and Innovative Vaccine Effectiveness (DRIVE) project is a public–private partnership aiming to build capacity in Europe for yearly estimation of brand-specific influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE). DRIVE is a five-year project funded by IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative). It was initiated as a response to the guidance on influenza vaccines by EMA (European Medicines Agency), which advised vaccine manufacturers to work with public health institutes to set up a joint IVE study platform. The COVID-19 pandemic reached Europe in February 2020 and overlapped with the 2019/2020 influenza season only in the last weeks. However, several elements of the DRIVE study network were impacted. The pandemic specifically affected the study sites’ routines and the subsequent assessment of the 2019/20 influenza season. Moreover, the current social distancing measures and lockdown policies across Europe are expected to also limit the circulation of influenza for the 2020/21 season, and therefore the impact of COVID-19 will be higher than in the season 2019/20. Consequently, DRIVE has planned to adapt its study platform to the COVID-19 challenge, encompassing several COVID-19 particularities in the study procedures, data collection and IVE analysis for the 2020/21 season. DRIVE will study the feasibility of implementing these COVID-19 components and establish the foundations of future COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness studies.
