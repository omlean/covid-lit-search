TELEASSISTANCE IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: RESULTS FROM A PILOT STUDY
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND Telemedicine in chronic disease management has received a significant boost during the health emergency from COVID-19. Diabetes and technologies supporting diabetes care as devices monitoring glucose, software analyzing glucose data, and systems delivering insulin are examples of how it is possible to develop remote and structured disease management. Indeed, most of the currently available technologies store and transfer data on the web to be shared with health care providers. OBJECTIVE During this devastating pandemic, we have decided to offer our patients the opportunity to manage diabetes remotely by implementing technology. Therefore, we have designed our research with the aim to evaluate the effectiveness of two virtual visits on glycemic control parameters in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) during the lockdown period. METHODS This is a prospective observational study, including T1D patients who completed two virtual visits during the lockdown for COVID-19. The glucose outcomes evaluating the benefit of the virtual contact were time in range (TIR), time above and below range, mean daily glucose, glucose management indicator (GMI), and glycemic variability. This metric was generated by specific computer programs that automatically upload data from the devices used to monitor blood or interstitial glucose. If needed, we changed ongoing treatment at the first virtual visit. RESULTS Among 209 eligible T1D patients, 166 completed two virtual visits, 35 failed to download glucose data, and 8 refused the visit. Among patients not included in the study, there was a significantly lower prevalence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) users (CGM, 16 vs. 93%; CSII 21 vs. 77%; p=0.0001) compared with patients who completed the study. TIR significantly increased from the first to the second virtual visit: first visit 6218 %, second visit 6417 % (p=0.02). The increase in TIR was more marked in patients using the traditional meter (N=11, baseline TIR 55±17 % and follow-up TIR 66±13 %, p=0.01) compared with patients using CGM, and in patients with baseline GMI 7.5 % (N=45, baseline TIR 45±15 % and follow-up TIR 53±18 %, p=0.0001) compared with patients with GMI <7.5%. The only variable independently associated with TIR was the change of ongoing therapy. The unstandardized beta coefficient and [95% CI] were 5 [0.7-8], p=0.02. The type of glucose monitoring and insulin delivery systems did not influence glucometric parameters. CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that the structured virtual visits allow the persistence and the improvement of glycemic control in situations where the office visit is not feasible.

Adoption of Telemedicine for Type 1 Diabetes Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND We describe the utilization of telemedicine visits (video or telephone) across the T1D Exchange Quality Improvement Collaborative (T1DX-QI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Metrics, site-level survey results, and examples of interventions conducted to support telemedicine in type 1 diabetes (T1D) are shown. METHODS Thirteen clinics (11 pediatric, 2 adult) provided monthly telemedicine metrics between December 2019-August 2020 and 21 clinics completed a survey about their telemedicine practices. RESULTS The proportion of telemedicine visits in T1DX-QI before the pandemic was less than 1%, rising to an average of 95.2% in April 2020 (range 52.3% to 99.5). Three sites initially used mostly telephone visits before converting to video visits. By August 2020, the proportion of telemedicine visits decreased to an average of 45% across T1DX-QI (range 10% to 86.6%). The majority of clinics (62%) performed both video and telephone visits; Zoom was the most popular video platform used. Over 95% of clinics reported using CareLink™, Clarity®, Glooko™ and/or t:connect® to view device data, with only one center reporting automated data upload into the electronic medical record. The majority of centers had multidisciplinary teams participating in the video visits. All sites reported reimbursement for video visits, and 95% of sites reported coverage for telephone visits early on in the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS There was rapid adoption of telemedicine in T1DX-QI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future insurance reimbursement for telemedicine visits and the ideal ratio of telemedicine to in-person visits in T1D care remain to be determined.

Teleassistance for Patients With Type 1 Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a Pilot Study
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND: Telemedicine use in chronic disease management has markedly increased during health emergencies due to COVID-19. Diabetes and technologies supporting diabetes care, including glucose monitoring devices, software analyzing glucose data, and insulin delivering systems, would facilitate remote and structured disease management. Indeed, most of the currently available technologies to store and transfer web-based data to be shared with health care providers. OBJECTIVE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided our patients the opportunity to manage their diabetes remotely by implementing technology. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 2 virtual visits on glycemic control parameters among patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) during the lockdown period. METHODS: This prospective observational study included T1D patients who completed 2 virtual visits during the lockdown period. The glucose outcomes that reflected the benefits of the virtual consultation were time in range (TIR), time above range, time below range, mean daily glucose, glucose management indicator (GMI), and glycemic variability. This metric was generated using specific computer programs that automatically upload data from the devices used to monitor blood or interstitial glucose levels. If needed, we changed the ongoing treatment at the first virtual visit. RESULTS: Among 209 eligible patients with T1D, 166 completed 2 virtual visits, 35 failed to download glucose data, and 8 declined the visit. Among the patients not included in the study, we observed a significantly lower proportion of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) users (n=7/43, 16% vs n=155/166, 93.4% and n=9/43, 21% vs n=128/166, 77.1%, respectively; P<.001) compared to patients who completed the study. TIR significantly increased from the first (62%, SD 18%) to the second (65%, SD 16%) virtual visit (P=.02); this increase was more marked among patients using the traditional meter (n=11; baseline TIR=55%, SD 17% and follow-up TIR=66%, SD 13%; P=.01) than among those using CGM, and in those with a baseline GMI of &#8805;7.5% (n=46; baseline TIR=45%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=53%, SD 18%; P<.001) than in those with a GMI of <7.5% (n=120; baseline TIR=68%, SD 15% and follow-up TIR=69%, SD 15%; P=.98). The only variable independently associated with TIR was the change of ongoing therapy. The unstandardized beta coefficient (B) and 95% CI were 5 (95% CI 0.7-8.0) (P=.02). The type of glucose monitoring device and insulin delivery systems did not influence glucometric parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the structured virtual visits help maintain and improve glycemic control in situations where in-person visits are not feasible.

Benefits of Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Pregnancy
Abstract: 
 In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has become increasingly available with the introduction of devices that are specifically approved for use during pregnancy. Evidence in the form of randomized-controlled trials and cohort studies continues to build support for the use of CGM during pregnancy to improve measures of maternal glycemia as well as obstetric and neonatal outcomes. Based on data from the CGM in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (CONCEPTT) trial alongside a Swedish cohort study of real-world outcomes of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes, the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines now recommend that real-time CGM be offered to all pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. Based on these guidelines, all pregnant individuals in the United Kingdom with type 1 diabetes will receive government-funded real-time CGM for a 12-month duration. These guidelines are a game-changer and will continue to facilitate more widespread access to CGM use in the United Kingdom and beyond. This review describes the role of CGM in the management of diabetes in pregnancy, discusses contemporary maternal glucose levels and their relationship with outcomes in diabetes pregnancies, and examines the high-quality, randomized-controlled trial and the real-world clinical data evaluating the impact of CGM use.
