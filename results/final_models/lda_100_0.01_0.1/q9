Microbial Contamination Risk and Disinfection of Radiation Protective Garments
Abstract: 
 ABSTRACT Healthcare-associated infections are a major public health concern for both patients and medical personnel. This has taken on greater urgency during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Radiation Personal Protective Equipment (RPPE) may contribute to risks of microbial contamination. This possibility was tested in 61 personal or shared-use lead aprons and thyroid collars at Columbia Presbyterian Irving Medical Center. Fifty percent tested positive for either bacterial or fungal contamination, mostly around the neckline of lead vests and thyroid collars. Repeated testing of garments some weeks to months later confirmed continued presence of microbial contamination. The possibility that hospital-approved disinfection agents could degrade the radio-protective features of these garments was also examined. Samples of identical construction to garments in regular use were subjected to either daily or weekly wipes with hypochlorite or alcohol-based hospital-approved cleaning agents for 6 mo. A third group of samples was maintained in contact with the cleaning agents for 6 mo. All samples were fluoroscoped four times during the study. None demonstrated any degradation in radioprotection. All samples were photographed monthly. Physical degradation of the outer plastic covering by concentrated hypochlorite and limited mechanical damage around stitched seams of the samples cleaned daily with alcohol was noted. Based on the high prevalence of microbial contamination, regular cleaning and disinfection protocols should be implemented. Regular cleaning with medical-facility-approved cleaning and disinfecting agents is likely to be effective at reducing the microbial load and unlikely to result in significant reduction in radioprotective properties of these garments.

Analysis of the materials for the manufacture of masks: The challenge of facing the shortage of personal protective equipment./ Análisis de los materiales para la fabricación de mascarillas: el reto de hacer frente a la escasez de equipos de protección individual
Abstract: 
 The main element of personal protective equipment against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are masks, which protect against droplets and aerosols that can remain suspended in the air. The objective of this study is to summarize the existing evidence on the filtration of different materials for the manufacture of masks. A scoping review or exploratory review has been carried out in the PubMEd and Scopus databases, using the terms "respirator", "mask", "facemask", "material", and "tissue", combined with Boolean operators. The results show some of the materials used for the manufacture of masks, both surgical masks and medium-high filtration masks, as well as materials used for the manufacture of household masks. As a conclusion, it is necessary to know the characteristics of the different materials as well as their properties to guarantee an adequate use according to the specific needs in each context, being fundamental the application of particle filtration systems as well as support materials that comply with current recommendations.

SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers despite the use of surgical masks and physical distancing - the role of airborne transmission
Abstract: 
 SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets. A key question in COVID-19 pandemic is whether it could be transmitted via airborne route as well. We report for the first time SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial infections, despite using surgical masks and physical distancing. It may provide a possible evidence for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Overview of Current International Recommendations for Echocardiography Exams During the Covid-19 Pandemic and Its Local Implementation in Austria
Abstract: 
 Since its first appearance in December 2019, the novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has spread throughout the world at rapid pace causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Originating in the Chinese province Hubei, more than 91.8 million people globally have now been infected with the coronavirus and more than 1.966.000 patients have died thus far from Covid-19 (as of January 13th 2021). The virus spreads primarily by droplet infection as well as via aerosols during close physical contact. Particularly in medical examinations with close physical contact between examiner and patient, like echocardiography, the risk of contracting the virus is increased. Therefore, the use of personal protective equipment is recommended for the protection of patients and medical personnel alike. In this article, the current recommendations of international professional associations on the use of personal protective equipment and their local implementation are presented.

Absence of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission from Children in Isolation to Guardians, South Korea
Abstract: 
 We explored transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among 12 children and their uninfected guardians in hospital isolation rooms in South Korea. We found that, even with close frequent contact, guardians who used appropriate personal protective equipment were not infected by children with diagnosed coronavirus disease.
