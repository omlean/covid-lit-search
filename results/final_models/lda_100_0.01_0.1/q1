Serial population-based sero-surveys for COVID-19 in two neighborhoods of Karachi, Pakistan
Abstract: 
 OBJECTIVE To determine population-based estimates of COVID-19 in a densely populated urban community of Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted in April, June and August in low- and high-transmission neighborhoods. Participants were randomly selected to provide blood for Elecsys® immunoassay for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Bayesian regression model was used to estimate seroprevalence after adjusting for the demographic characteristics of each district RESULTS: We enrolled 3005 participants from 623 households. In Phase 2, adjusted seroprevalence was estimated as 8.7% (95% CI 5.1-13.1) and 15.1% (95% CI 9.4 -21.7) in low and high transmission areas respectively, compared to 0.2% (95% CI 0-0.7) and 0.4% (95% CI 0 - 1.3) in Phase 1. In Phase 3, it was 12.8% (95% CI 8.3 - 17.7) and 21.5% (95% CI 15.6-28) in low and high transmission areas, respectively. CRI was 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.47) and 0.41(95% CI 0.28-0.52) in low and high transmission neighborhoods respectively in Phase 2. Similar trends were observed in Phase 3. Only 5.4% of participants who tested positive for COVID-19 were symptomatic. IFR was 1.66%, 0.37% and 0.26% in Phases 1, 2 and 3 respectively. CONCLUSION Continuing rounds of seroprevalence studies will help us better understand secular trends and extent of infection during the course of the pandemic.

Clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of pediatric COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis
Abstract: 
 ABSTRACT Pediatric cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. This meta-analysis was aimed at describing the clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics of children with COVID-19 based on published data of pediatric COVID-19 cases.Search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences, Science Direct, and Google Scholar for articles published until December 14, 2020, that described the clinical, laboratory, and imaging features of children with COVID-19. Data were extracted independently by 2 authors. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to report pooled results.Clinical data from 2874 children with COVID-19 from 37 articles were finally included for quantitative analyses. Fever (48.5%, 95% CI: 41.4%-55.6%) and cough (40.6%, 95% CI: 33.9%-47.5%) were the most common symptoms; asymptomatic infection and severe cases, respectively, accounted for 27.7% (95% CI: 19.7%-36.4%) patients and 1.1% of the 1933 patients included. Laboratory tests showed 5.5% (95% CI: 2.8%-8.9%) of the patients had lymphopenia. The pooled prevalence of leukopenia was 7.3% (95% CI: 3.4%-12.2%), and the C-reactive protein level was high in 14.0% (95% CI: 6.8%-22.8%). Chest computed tomography showed unilateral and bilateral lesions, and ground-glass opacity in 29.4% (95% CI: 24.8%-34.3%) and 24.7% (95% CI: 18.2%-31.6%), and 32.9% (95% CI: 25.3%-40.9%), respectively, and normal in approximately 36.0% (95% CI: 27.7%-44.7%).We found that children with COVID-19 had relatively mild disease, with quite a lot of asymptomatic infections and low rate of severe illness. Data from more regions are needed to determine the prevention and treatment strategies for children with COVID-19.

COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease 2019 has been increasingly recognized. However, the clinical features of MIS-C and the differences from Kawasaki disease remain unknown. The study aims to investigate the epidemiology and clinical course of MIS-C. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched through August 30, 2020. Observational studies describing MIS-C were included. Data regarding demographic features, clinical symptoms, laboratory, echocardiography and radiology findings, treatments, and outcomes were extracted. Study-specific estimates were combined using one-group meta-analysis in a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were identified including 917 MIS-C patients. The mean age was 9.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.4-10.1). The pooled proportions of Hispanic and Black cases were 34.6% (95% CI, 28.3-40.9) and 31.5% (95% CI, 24.8-38.1), respectively. The common manifestations were gastrointestinal symptoms (87.3%; 95% CI, 82.9-91.6) and cardiovascular involvement such as myocardial dysfunction (55.3%; 95% CI, 42.4-68.2), coronary artery aneurysms (21.7%; 95% CI, 12.8-30.1) and shock (65.8%; 95% CI, 51.1-80.4), with marked elevated inflammatory and cardiac markers. The majority of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (81.0%; 95% CI, 75.0-86.9), aspirin (67.3%; 95% CI, 48.8-85.7), and corticosteroids (63.6%; 95% CI, 53.4-73.8) with a variety of anti-inflammatory agents. Although myocardial dysfunction improved in 55.1% (95% CI, 33.4-76.8) at discharge, the rate of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use was 6.3% (95% CI, 2.8-9.8) and the mortality was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.0-2.8). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MIS-C leads to multiple organ failure, including gastrointestinal manifestations, myocardial dysfunction and coronary abnormalities, and has distinct features from Kawasaki disease.

COVID-19 under 19: A meta-analysis
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to cause global havoc posing uncertainty to educational institutions worldwide. Understanding the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children is important because of the potential impact on clinical management and public health decisions. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted for pediatric COVID-19 studies using PubMed and Scopus. It reviewed demographics, co-morbidities, clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations, radiological investigations, treatment, and outcomes. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized. RESULTS: Out of 3927 articles, 31 articles comprising of 1816 patients were selected from December 2019 to early October 2020 and were defined by 77 variables. Of these studies 58% originated from China and the remainder from North America, Europe and the Middle East. This meta-analysis revealed that 19.2% (CI 13.6%-26.4%) of patients were asymptomatic. Fever (57%, CI 49.7%-64%) and cough (44.1%, CI 38.3%-50.2%) were the most common symptoms. The most frequently encountered white blood count abnormalities were lymphopenia 13.5% (CI 8.2%-21.4%) and leukopenia 12.6% (CI 8.5%-18.3%). Ground glass opacities were the most common radiological finding of children with COVID-19 (35.5%, CI 28.9%-42.7%). Hospitalization rate was 96.3% (CI 92.4%-98.2%) of which 10.8% (CI 4.2%-25.3%) were ICU admissions, and 2.4% (CI 1.7%-3.4%) died. CONCLUSION: The majority of pediatric patients with COVID-19 were asymptomatic or had mild manifestations. Among hospitalized patients there remains a significant number that require intensive care unit care. Overall across the literature, a considerable level of understanding of COVID-19 in children was reached, yet emerging data related to multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children should be explored.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID‐19 and comparison with control patients: A systematic review and meta‐analysis
Abstract: 
 In a large‐scale study, 128176 non‐pregnant patients (228 studies) and 10000 pregnant patients (121 studies) confirmed COVID‐19 cases included in this Meta‐Analysis. The mean (confidence interval [CI]) of age and gestational age of admission (GA) in pregnant women was 33 (28–37) years old and 36 (34–37) weeks, respectively. Pregnant women show the same manifestations of COVID‐19 as non‐pregnant adult patients. Fever (pregnant: 75.5%; non‐pregnant: 74%) and cough (pregnant: 48.5%; non‐pregnant: 53.5%) are the most common symptoms in both groups followed by myalgia (26.5%) and chill (25%) in pregnant and dysgeusia (27%) and fatigue (26.5%) in non‐pregnant patients. Pregnant women are less probable to show cough (odds ratio [OR] 0.7; 95% CI 0.67–0.75), fatigue (OR: 0.58; CI: 0.54–0.61), sore throat (OR: 0.66; CI: 0.61–0.7), headache (OR: 0.55; CI: 0.55–0.58) and diarrhea (OR: 0.46; CI: 0.4–0.51) than non‐pregnant adult patients. The most common imaging found in pregnant women is ground‐glass opacity (57%) and in non‐pregnant patients is consolidation (76%). Pregnant women have higher proportion of leukocytosis (27% vs. 14%), thrombocytopenia (18% vs. 12.5%) and have lower proportion of raised C‐reactive protein (52% vs. 81%) compared with non‐pregnant patients. Leucopenia and lymphopenia are almost the same in both groups. The most common comorbidity in pregnant patients is diabetes (18%) and in non‐pregnant patients is hypertension (21%). Case fatality rate (CFR) of non‐pregnant hospitalized patients is 6.4% (4.4–8.5), and mortality due to all‐cause for pregnant patients is 11.3% (9.6–13.3). Regarding the complications of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage (54.5% [7–94]), caesarean delivery (48% [42–54]), preterm labor (25% [4–74]) and preterm birth (21% [12–34]) are in turn the most prevalent complications. Comparing the pregnancy outcomes show that caesarean delivery (OR: 3; CI: 2–5), low birth weight (LBW) (OR: 9; CI: 2.4–30) and preterm birth (OR: 2.5; CI: 1.5–3.5) are more probable in pregnant woman with COVID‐19 than pregnant women without COVID‐19. The most prevalent neonatal complications are neonatal intensive care unit admission (43% [2–96]), fetal distress (30% [12–58]) and LBW (25% [16–37]). The rate of vertical transmission is 5.3% (1.3–16), and the rate of positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test for neonates born to mothers with COVID‐19 is 8% (4–16). Overall, pregnant patients present with the similar clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 when compared with the general population, but they may be more asymptomatic. Higher odds of caesarean delivery, LBW and preterm birth among pregnant patients with COVID‐19 suggest a possible association between COVID‐19 infection and pregnancy complications. Low risk of vertical transmission is present, and SARS‐CoV‐2 can be detected in all conception products, particularly placenta and breast milk. Interpretations of these results should be done cautiously due to the heterogeneity between studies; however, we believe our findings can guide the prenatal and postnatal considerations for COVID‐19 pregnant patients.
