In Vitro Assessment of the Antiviral Activity of Ketotifen, Indomethacin and Naproxen, Alone and in Combination, against SARS-CoV-2
Abstract: 
 The 2019 coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is caused by infection with the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, the treatment options for COVID-19 are limited. The purpose of the experiments presented here was to investigate the effectiveness of ketotifen, naproxen and indomethacin, alone or in combination, in reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the drugs was evaluated. The findings showed that the combination of ketotifen with indomethacin (SJP-002C) or naproxen both reduce viral yield. Compared to ketotifen alone (60% inhibition at EC50), an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 79%, 83% and 93% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 μM indomethacin, respectively. Compared to ketotifen alone, an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 68%, 68% and 92% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 μM naproxen, respectively. For both drug combinations the observations suggest an additive or synergistic effect, compared to administering the drugs alone. No cytotoxic effects were observed for the administered dosages of ketotifen, naproxen, and indomethacin. Further research is warranted to investigate the efficacy of the combination of ketotifen with indomethacin (SJP-002C) or naproxen in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

The impact of cholecalciferol on markers of vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients: A randomized placebo controlled study
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND AND AIM Vascular calcification is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality in end stage renal disease, and particularly in hemodialysis patients. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with vascular calcification among this category of patients. Cholecalciferol or vitamin D3; the native inactivated 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], has been proposed to have a good impact on vascular calcification and vitamin D deficiency. However, clinical data is still limited. METHODS AND RESULTS A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study was carried out to evaluate the effect of oral cholecalciferol on vascular calcification and 25(OH)D levels in hemodialysis patients. A total of sixty eligible hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to either a treatment group (Oral 200.000IU Cholecalciferol per month) or a placebo group, for 3 months. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), osteoprotegerin (OPG), calcium, phosphorus, their product (CaXP) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels, were all assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT03602430. Cholecalciferol significantly increased serum levels of 25(OH)D and fetuin-A in the treatment group (p-value < 0.001), while no significant difference was observed in the placebo group. Cholecalciferol administration showed no effect on either FGF-23 or OPG. None of the treatment group patients experienced any adverse effects. CONCLUSION Cholecalciferol was shown to be an effective, tolerable, inexpensive pharmacotherapeutic option to overcome vitamin D deficiency, with a possible modulating effect on fetuin-A, among hemodialysis patients. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV REGISTRATION NUMBER NCT03602430.

Report on recent advances in treatment options through vitamins
Abstract: 
 Vitamins are the essential dietary components that are required in trace amounts by our body for the proper functioning of its biochemical processes and to prevent the deficiency diseases The case of an infant having epileptic seizures at birth is discussed, which was found to be pyridoxine (vitamin B6)-dependent It has been discovered through recent researches that vitamin K is involved in the immunology, atherosclerosis, inflammation and bone mineralization Vitamin C is found to act as an anti-tumor agent when used intravenously in high doses Recent researches have led us to understand that vitamins have a broader spectrum of functions than they are anticipated to have in our body and can be used to treat much more diseases when used alone, in combination or via different routes or in different concentrations or doses

Adjunctive Nutraceutical Therapies for COVID-19
Abstract: 
 The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19), is a worldwide pandemic, as declared by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is a respiratory virus that infects people of all ages. Although it may present with mild to no symptoms in most patients, those who are older, immunocompromised, or with multiple comorbidities may present with severe and life-threatening infections. Throughout history, nutraceuticals, such as a variety of phytochemicals from medicinal plants and dietary supplements, have been used as adjunct therapies for many disease conditions, including viral infections. Appropriate use of these adjunct therapies with antiviral proprieties may be beneficial in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of COVID-19. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of nutraceuticals, such as vitamins C, D, E, zinc, melatonin, and other phytochemicals and function foods. These nutraceuticals may have potential therapeutic efficacies in fighting the threat of the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic.

A pilot double‐blind safety and feasibility randomized controlled trial of high‐dose intravenous zinc in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients
Abstract: 
 Zinc inhibits replication of the SARS‐CoV virus. We aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and biological effect of administering high‐dose intravenous zinc (HDIVZn) to patients with COVID‐19. We performed a Phase IIa double‐blind, randomized controlled trial to compare HDIVZn to placebo in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19. We administered trial treatment per day for a maximum of 7 days until either death or hospital discharge. We measured zinc concentration at baseline and during treatment and observed patients for any significant side effects. For eligible patients, we randomized and administered treatment to 33 adult participants to either HDIVZn (n = 15) or placebo (n = 18). We observed no serious adverse events throughout the study for a total of 94 HDIVZn administrations. However, three participants in the HDIVZn group reported infusion site irritation. Mean serum zinc on Day 1 in the placebo, and the HDIVZn group was 6.9 ± 1.1 and 7.7 ± 1.6 µmol/l, respectively, consistent with zinc deficiency. HDIVZn, but not placebo, increased serum zinc levels above the deficiency cutoff of 10.7 µmol/l (p < .001) on Day 6. Our study did not reach its target enrollment because stringent public health measures markedly reduced patient hospitalizations. Hospitalized COVID‐19 patients demonstrated zinc deficiency. This can be corrected with HDIVZn. Such treatment appears safe, feasible, and only associated with minimal peripheral infusion site irritation. This pilot study justifies further investigation of this treatment in COVID‐19 patients.
