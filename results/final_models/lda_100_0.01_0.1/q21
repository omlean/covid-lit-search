Three-Phase Model
Abstract: 
 This chapter provides the Three-Phase Model as risk management technique. With this model, a manager can come to grips with the situation in which an organization finds itself, or in which various of its sub-components are situated. The Three-Phase Model works like GPS (Global Positioning System) for leaders. It indicates in which stage of risk development the organization is. At the same time, the Three-Phase Model can be used to ascertain demands on leaders arising in each of the different phases.

Clinical and public health utility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis whole genome sequencing
Abstract: 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 10 million people develop tuberculosis (TB) every year, with 1.5 million deaths attributed to TB in 2019 (World Health Organization, 2020). The majority of the disease burden occurs in low-income countries, where access to diagnostics and tailored treatment remains problematic. The current COVID-19 pandemic further threatens to impact global TB control by diverting resources, reducing notifications and hence significantly increasing deaths attributable to TB (World Health Organization, 2020). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming increasingly accessible, and has particular value in the diagnosis and management of TB disease (Cabibbe et al., 2018; Meehan et al., 2019). Not only does it have the potential to give more rapid and complete information on drug-resistance, but the high discriminatory power it offers allows detection of clusters and transmission pathways, as well as likely contamination events, mixed infections and to differentiate between re-infection and relapse with much greater confidence than previous typing methods.

Aspects of distance education in combination with home offices
Abstract: 
 This article discusses the impact of a lockdown caused by the novel coronavirus disease 2019 on the educational process at a selected faculty of a public university in the Czech Republic focused on economic education The aim was to capture relevant aspects in the context of impacts on the management of the educational process in the organization The unique situation brought the possibility of analyzing the flexibility of the organization, its ability to adapt A questionnaire survey was conducted among academics We found out how they coped with this situation, their technical equipment, support from the faculty, and whether they encountered any problems The goal of the article was not to bring an exact evaluation of selected questions, but to show the state of the actual situation, to point out possible problems of users, and to link these things with the approach to the management of the organization Based on the analysis, we bring suggestions and recommendations for improving the process of transition to online learning as well as distance education management and recommendation to support teaching, regardless of the teacher’s workplace The basic areas and activities that need to be managed were also identified © 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland
