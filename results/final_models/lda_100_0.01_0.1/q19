Perspectives on Targeting IL-6 as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy for COVID-19
Abstract: 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has been a major threat to global public health. In Indonesia, the cases have rapidly increased, and the case fatality rate remains high. With COVID-19, most of the deaths have been caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome and dysregulation of the immune response. A lung biopsy from a patient with COVID-19 showed inflammatory cellular infiltration with diffuse alveolar damage. Massive pulmonary destruction has also been reported as a result of highly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), induced protein 10 (IP-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine produced by various cell types, including immune cells and nonleukocytes, such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, and certain tumor cells. Several studies have shown that IL-6 contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. In this review, we would like to explore the immune response in COVID-19 and the role of IL-6 in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.

COVID-19 Is an Endothelial Disease: Implications of Nitric Oxide
Abstract: 
 Endothelial cells are a clinically important infection site for COVID-19, both as a mechanism for disease pathogenesis and as a therapeutic target. People with dysfunctional endothelium, defined by nitric oxide deficiency, appear to have a more severe disease course. As such, nitric oxide has therapeutic potential to mitigate COVID-19 severity. Inhaled nitric oxide appears to improve outcomes, although this strategy neglects systemic endothelium. Meanwhile, early studies have documented that endothelial protective medications, such as the administration of statins and ACE-inhibitors, are associated with less severe disease and reduced mortality. Importantly, these medications augment endothelial sources of nitric oxide, which may explain this effect.

Diabetic fibrosis
Abstract: 
 Diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality is predominantly due to complications of the disease that may cause debilitating conditions, such as heart and renal failure, hepatic insufficiency, retinopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Fibrosis, the excessive and inappropriate deposition of extracellular matrix in various tissues, is commonly found in patients with advanced type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and may contribute to organ dysfunction. Hyperglycemia, lipotoxic injury and insulin resistance activate a fibrotic response, not only through direct stimulation of matrix synthesis by fibroblasts, but also by promoting a fibrogenic phenotype in immune and vascular cells, and possibly also by triggering epithelial and endothelial cell conversion to a fibroblast-like phenotype. High glucose stimulates several fibrogenic pathways, triggering reactive oxygen species generation, stimulating neurohumoral responses, activating growth factor cascades (such as TGF-ß/Smad3 and PDGFs), inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, generating advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and stimulating the AGE-RAGE axis, and upregulating fibrogenic matricellular proteins. Although diabetes-activated fibrogenic signaling has common characteristics in various tissues, some organs, such as the heart, kidney and liver develop more pronounced and clinically significant fibrosis. This review manuscript summarizes current knowledge on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in diabetic fibrosis, discussing the fundamental links between metabolic perturbations and fibrogenic activation, the basis for organ-specific differences, and the promises and challenges of anti-fibrotic therapies for diabetic patients.

Efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected dying cells impairs macrophage anti-inflammatory programming and continual clearance of apoptotic cells
Abstract: 
 COVID-19 is a disease of dysfunctional immune responses, but the mechanisms triggering immunopathogenesis are not established. The functional plasticity of macrophages allows this cell type to promote pathogen elimination and inflammation or suppress inflammation and promote tissue remodeling and injury repair. During an infection, the clearance of dead and dying cells, a process named efferocytosis, can modulate the interplay between these contrasting functions. Here, we show that engulfment of SARS-CoV2-infected apoptotic cells (AC) exacerbates inflammatory cytokine production, inhibits the expression of efferocytic receptors, and impairs continual efferocytosis by macrophages. We also provide evidence that monocytes from severe COVID-19 patients express reduced levels of efferocytic receptors and fail to uptake AC. Our findings reveal that dysfunctional efferocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cell corpses suppress macrophage anti-inflammation and efficient tissue repair programs and provide mechanistic insights for the pathogenesis of the hyperinflammation and extensive tissue damage associated with COVID-19.
