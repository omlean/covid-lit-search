Vaccinology in the post-COVID-19 era
Abstract: 
 The COVID-19 pandemic is a shocking reminder of how our world would look in the absence of vaccination. Fortunately, new technologies, the pace of understanding new and existing pathogens, and the increased knowledge of the immune system allow us today to develop vaccines at an unprecedented speed. Some of the vaccine technologies that are fast-tracked by the urgency of COVID-19 may also be the answer for other health priorities, such as antimicrobial resistance, chronic infections, and cancer, that the post-COVID-19 world will urgently need to face. This perspective analyzes the way COVID-19 is transforming vaccinology and the opportunities for vaccines to have an increasingly important role in health and well-being.

SARS-CoV-2: vaccines in the pandemic era
Abstract: 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused millions of infections and deaths worldwide since its emergence in December 2019. As there is little or no natural immunity in the human population or specific anti-COVID-19 drugs, researchers from the government, academia and industry are developing vaccines at an unprecedented speed to halt the pandemic. In this review, the results of animal experiments and clinical trials on several vaccine technical platforms are summarized, and several challenges are also discussed to further promote the development, evaluation and application of vaccines during the challenging situation of the global pandemic.

Analysis of the COVID-19 Vaccine Development Process: an Exploratory Study of Accelerating Factors and Innovative Environments
Abstract: 
 PURPOSE: The pace of the COVID-19 vaccine development process is unprecedented and is challenging the traditional paradigm of vaccinology science. The main pressure comes from the pandemic situation, but what makes it possible is a complex set of factors and innovative environments built along the times, which this manuscript aims to study. METHODS: Through an exploratory study within the scope of innovation management, the present manuscript aims to identify and explore factors that are promoting this accelerated development scenario. The method comprises the monitoring of the strategies adopted by the developers and other stakeholders, as regulatory and humanitarian agencies, specific mechanisms from governments and non-governments bodies, and the background technology that has paved this pathway. RESULTS: Technology-based and R&D strategy factors are the two main factors identified and explored herein. The breakthrough in the field of biotechnology and molecular biology is considered the main base-science that enables the rapid development of new vaccines. Additionally, new technological platforms can also be pointed out. Relating to R&D strategies, the parallelism of phases and adaptive clinical trials in consonance with regulatory agencies are the most relevant. CONCLUSIONS: The need to rapidly develop a vaccine against COVID-19 occurs at a time of great excitement in basic scientific understanding, as well as strategies learned in the past by industry and optimization of regulatory pathways. It is expected that these factors, arising from the global emergency, may redirect the R&D processes for new drugs, especially in times of pandemic.

Advancing innovation for vaccine manufacturers from developing countries: Prioritization, barriers, opportunities
Abstract: 
 Development of novel vaccines and improving existing vaccines is critical to addressing areas of unmet or under-addressed health needs globally and to improving existing vaccination coverage and equity. However, vaccine innovation is costly and highly complex. To understand how vaccine manufacturers from developing countries approach innovation, a survey was conducted among company members of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network, in collaboration with the Clinton Health Access Initiative. The survey confirmed that vaccine manufacturers from developing countries are committed to vaccine innovation: 95% of respondents have interest in pursuing vaccine innovation, with strategies targeted towards supplying to low- and middle-income countries. Key barriers to innovation were also surveyed, with respondents highlighting challenges regarding access to in-licensing or joint venture partnerships, financing, and regulatory barriers. Opportunities for innovation are also discussed.
