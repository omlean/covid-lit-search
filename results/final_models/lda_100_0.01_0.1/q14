Mendelian randomization analysis identified genes pleiotropically associated with central corneal thickness
Abstract: 
 Objective: To prioritize genes that were pleiotropically or potentially causally associated with central corneal thickness (CCT). Methods: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method integrating summarized data of genome-wide association study (GWAS) on CCT and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with CCT. We performed separate SMR analysis using CAGE eQTL data and GTEx eQTL data. SMR analysis were done for participants of European and East Asian ancestries, separately. Results: We identified multiple genes showing pleiotropic association with CCT in the participants of European ancestry. CLIC3 (ILMN_1796423; PSMR=4.15*10^-12), PTGDS (ILMN_1664464; PSMR=6.88*10^-9) and C9orf142 (ILMN_1761138; PSMR=8.09*10^-9) were the top three genes using the CAGE eQTL data, and RP11-458F8.4 (ENSG00000273142.1; PSMR=5.89*10^-9), LCNL1 (ENSG00000214402.6; PSMR=5.67*10^-8), and PTGDS (ENSG00000107317.7; PSMR=1.92*10^-7) were the top three genes using the GTEx eQTL data. No genes showed significantly pleiotropic association with CCT in the participants of East Asian ancestry after correction for multiple testing. Conclusion: We identified several genes pleiotropically associated with CCT, some of which represented novel genes influencing CCT. Our findings provided important leads to a better understanding of the genetic factors influencing CCT, and revealed potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma and keratoconus.

Genetic regulation of homeostatic immune architecture in the lungs of Collaborative Cross mice
Abstract: 
 Variation in immune homeostasis, immune system stability, in organ systems such as the lungs is likely to shape the host response to infection at these exposed tissues. We evaluated immune homeostasis in immune cell populations in the lungs of the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse genetic reference population. We found vast heritable variation in leukocyte populations with the frequency of many of these cell types showing distinct patterns relative to classic inbred strains C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ. We identified 28 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in baseline lung immune cell populations, including several loci that broadly regulate the abundance of immune populations from distinct developmental lineages, and found that many of these loci have predictive value for influenza disease outcomes, demonstrating that genetic determinants of homeostatic immunity in the lungs regulate susceptibility to virus-induced disease. All told, we highlight the need to assess diverse mouse strains in understanding immune homeostasis and resulting immune responses.

SARS-CoV-2: The Road Less Traveled-From the Respiratory Mucosa to the Brain
Abstract: 
 Neurological manifestations have been reported in COVID-19;however, the route used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter the brain is still under debate Recent studies have focused on the olfactory route SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were also detected in the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves originating from the lower brainstem and in isolated cells of the brainstem Our proof of concept in vivo real-time imaging study of mice using an indocyanine green dye indicated that the neurovascular component of the connective tissue of the respiratory mucosa can also provide an alternate route to the brain

Multi-omics highlights ABO plasma protein as a causal risk factor for COVID-19
Abstract: 
 SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the current health crisis. Despite intensive research efforts, the genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19 remain poorly understood. We, therefore, used an integrative genomics (IG) approach to identify candidate genes responsible for COVID-19 and its severity. We used Bayesian colocalization (COLOC) and summary-based Mendelian randomization to combine gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Lung eQTL (n = 1,038) and eQTLGen (n = 31,784) studies with published COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Additionally, we used COLOC to integrate plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from the INTERVAL study (n = 3,301) with COVID-19 loci. Finally, we determined any causal associations between plasma proteins and COVID-19 using multi-variable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). The expression of 18 genes in lung and/or blood co-localized with COVID-19 loci. Of these, 12 genes were in suggestive loci (P(GWAS) < 5 × 10(–05)). LZTFL1, SLC6A20, ABO, IL10RB and IFNAR2 and OAS1 had been previously associated with a heightened risk of COVID-19 (P(GWAS) < 5 × 10(–08)). We identified a causal association between OAS1 and COVID-19 GWAS. Plasma ABO protein, which is associated with blood type in humans, demonstrated a significant causal relationship with COVID-19 in the MR analysis; increased plasma levels were associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 and, in particular, severe COVID-19. In summary, our study identified genes associated with COVID-19 that may be prioritized for future investigations. Importantly, this is the first study to demonstrate a causal association between plasma ABO protein and COVID-19.

Predictive immunogenetic markers in COVID-19
Abstract: 
 Immunorelevant genes are among the most probable modulators of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progression and prognosis. However, in the few months of the pandemic, data generated on host genetics has been scarce. The present study retrieved data sets of HLA-B alleles, KIR genes and functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokines related to COVID-19 cytokine storm from two publicly available databases: Allele Frequency Net Database and Ensembl, and correlated these frequency data with Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Daily Death Rates (DDR) across countries. Correlations of eight HLA-B alleles and polymorphisms in three cytokine genes (IL6, IL10, and IL12B) were observed and were mainly associated with DDR. Additionally, HLA-B correlations suggest that differences in allele affinities to SARS-CoV-2 peptides are also associated with DDR. These results may provide rationale for future host genetic marker surveys on COVID-19.
