Taking a Stand to Remedy the Inadequacies of Action on Health Equity Exposed by COVID-19
Abstract: 
 As we struggle with the impacts of a global pandemic, there is growing evidence of the inequitable impacts of this crisis. In this commentary, we argue that actions on health equity to date have been insufficient despite significant scholarship to guide both practice and policy. To move from talk to action on health equity, we propose the following five approaches: (1) reversing the erosion of publicly funded health systems; (2) creating broad economic means to support health; (3) moving health action upstream; (4) challenging ageist and/or ableist discourses; and (5) decolonizing approaches and enacting solidarity. Engaging in these actions will help close the gaps and address disparities made more evident during this global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for us to move from discussion to action if we are to achieve health for all. Adopting a health equity lens is a means of both understanding and stimulating action to readdress the root causes of inequities and work toward a fairer, more just society.

Transforming the stories we tell about climate change: From 'issue' to 'action
Abstract: 
 By some counts, up to 98% of environmental news stories are negative in nature Implicit in this number is the conventional wisdom among many communicators that increasing people's understanding, awareness, concern or even fear of climate change are necessary precursors for action and behavior change In this article we review scientific theories of mind and brain that explain why this conventional view is flawed In real life, the relationship between beliefs and behavior often goes in the opposite direction: our actions change our beliefs, awareness and concerns through a process of self-justification and self-persuasion As one action leads to another, this process of self-persuasion can go hand in hand with a deepening engagement and the development of agency - knowing how to act One important source of agency is learning from the actions of others We therefore propose an approach to climate communication and storytelling that builds people's agency for climate action by providing a wide variety of stories of people taking positive action on climate change Applied at scale, this will shift the conceptualization of climate change from 'issue-based' to 'action-based' It will also expand the current dominant meanings of 'climate action' (i e 'consumer action' and 'activism') to incorporate all relevant practices people engage in as members of a community, as professionals and as citizens We close by proposing a systematic approach to get more reference material for action-based stories from science, technology and society to the communities of storytellers - learning from health communication and technologies developed for COVID-19 © 2020 The Author(s) Published by IOP Publishing Ltd

Fisher Information of Free-Electron Landau States
Abstract: 
 An electron in a constant magnetic field has energy levels, known as the Landau levels. One can obtain the corresponding radial wavefunction of free-electron Landau states in cylindrical polar coordinates. However, this system has not been explored so far in terms of an information-theoretical viewpoint. Here, we focus on Fisher information associated with these Landau states specified by the two quantum numbers. Fisher information provides a useful measure of the electronic structure in quantum systems, such as hydrogen-like atoms and under some potentials. By numerically evaluating the generalized Laguerre polynomials in the radial densities, we report that Fisher information increases linearly with the principal quantum number that specifies energy levels, but decreases monotonically with the azimuthal quantum number m. We also present relative Fisher information of the Landau states against the reference density with [Formula: see text] , which is proportional to the principal quantum number. We compare it with the case when the lowest Landau level state is set as the reference.
