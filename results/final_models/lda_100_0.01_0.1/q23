Characterizing genomic variants and mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins from Indian isolates
Abstract: 
 SARS-CoV-2 is mutating and creating divergent variants by altering the composition of essential constituent proteins. Pharmacologically, it is crucial to understand the diverse mechanism of mutations for stable vaccine or anti-viral drug design. Our current study concentrates on all the constituent proteins of 469 SARS-CoV-2 genome samples, derived from Indian patients. However, the study may easily be extended to the samples across the globe. We perform clustering analysis towards identifying unique variants in each of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A total of 536 mutated positions within the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are detected among the identified variants from Indian isolates. We quantify mutations by focusing on the unique variants of each SARS-CoV-2 protein. We report the average number of mutation per variant, percentage of mutated positions, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, mutations occurring in three codon positions and so on. Our study reveals the most susceptible six (06) proteins, which are ORF1ab, Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N), ORF3a, ORF7a, and ORF8. Several non-synonymous substitutions are observed to be unique in different SARS-CoV-2 proteins. A total of 57 possible deleterious amino acid substitutions are predicted, which may impact on the protein functions. Several mutations show a large decrease in protein stability and are observed in putative functional domains of the proteins that might have some role in disease pathogenesis. We observe a good number of physicochemical property change during above deleterious substitutions.

Genomic mutations and changes in protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus
Abstract: 
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic virus that has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus is crucial to respond to and control the pandemic through appropriate intervention strategies. This paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and their probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes, which are predicted using deep learning models. Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Based on 6324 viral genome sequences, we create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in many perspectives, especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus. Our analysis results also show that coding genes E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 are most stable, potentially suitable to be targeted for vaccine and drug development.

Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in the United States suggests presence of four substrains and novel variants
Abstract: 
 SARS-CoV-2 has been mutating since it was first sequenced in early January 2020. Here, we analyze 45,494 complete SARS-CoV-2 geneome sequences in the world to understand their mutations. Among them, 12,754 sequences are from the United States. Our analysis suggests the presence of four substrains and eleven top mutations in the United States. These eleven top mutations belong to 3 disconnected groups. The first and second groups consisting of 5 and 8 concurrent mutations are prevailing, while the other group with three concurrent mutations gradually fades out. Moreover, we reveal that female immune systems are more active than those of males in responding to SARS-CoV-2 infections. One of the top mutations, 27964C > T-(S24L) on ORF8, has an unusually strong gender dependence. Based on the analysis of all mutations on the spike protein, we uncover that two of four SARS-CoV-2 substrains in the United States become potentially more infectious.

COVID-19 Outbreak in Malaysia: Decoding D614G Mutation of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Isolated from an Asymptomatic Case in Pahang
Abstract: 
 SARS-CoV-2 is a very transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus which detected in Malaysia in January 2020. Nevertheless, the sample from Malaysia is still under-sequenced. Hence lacking clarity of the circulating strain in Malaysia leads to a deadlock in understanding the virus infectivity. This study aimed to investigate the genome identity of circulating COVID-19 strains in Pahang and understand disease epidemiology during the pandemic. This study leveraged high-throughput sequencing analysis for the whole genome sequencing and implemented bioinformatic technique for the analysis. Here we reported that the virus with D614G mutation in Spike protein circulates in a few Malaysia states before the Sivagangga cluster announced in Kedah in July 2020. This mutated virus includes our virus sample isolated in April 2020 from an asymptomatic patient in Pahang. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we discovered the origin of our sample Pahang/IIUM91 was not related to Sivagangga cluster. Here, we have generated 3D structure model of Pahang/IIUM91 Spike protein. D614G mutation in Pahang/IIUM91 Spike protein increases viral stability and flexibility, hence render higher infectivity. Collectively, our results suggest for the establishment of a complete SARS-CoV-2 genome database in Malaysia. Hence, more research should be established to learn the behaviour of this virus.

A Unique View of SARS-COV-2 through the Lens of ORF8 Protein
Abstract: 
 Immune evasion is one of the unique characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attributed to its ORF8 protein. This protein modulates the adaptive host immunity through down-regulation of MHC-1 (Major Histocompatibility Complex) molecules and innate immune responses by surpassing the host's interferon-mediated antiviral response. To understand the host's immune perspective concerning the ORF8 protein, a comprehensive study of the ORF8 protein and mutations possessed by it have been performed. Chemical and structural properties of ORF8 proteins from different hosts, such as human, bat, and pangolin, suggest that the ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 is much closer to ORF8 of Bat RaTG13-CoV than to that of Pangolin-CoV. Eighty-seven mutations across unique variants of ORF8 in SARS-CoV-2 can be grouped into four classes based on their predicted effects [1]. Based on the geo-locations and timescale of sample collection, a possible flow of mutations was built. Furthermore, conclusive flows of amalgamation of mutations were found upon sequence similarity analyses and consideration of the amino acid conservation phylogenies. Therefore, this study seeks to highlight the uniqueness of the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 through the ORF8.
