Searching for Evidence-Based Public Policy and Practice: Analysis of the Determinants of Personal/Public Adaptation and Mitigation Behavior against Particulate Matter by Focusing on the Roles of Risk Perception, Communication, and Attribution Factors
Abstract: 
 In recent years, awareness about the risk of particulate matter (PM) has increased both domestically and internationally; consequently, various policies have been implemented to reduce PM. Since citizens are both victim and cause of this risk, PM cannot be successfully decreased only through government policies. Therefore, citizens’ active participation is required to reduce PM and prevent its risks. However, a theoretical model about public behavior against PM has not been established. Therefore, we suggest the public behavior model about individuals’ response against PM, in which response actions are classified into four types based on the combinations of the public-personal domains and mitigation-adaptation actions: Personal or public adaptations, and personal or public mitigations. We analyze how risk perception, risk communication, blame attribution factors influence the four types of responses against PM. The analysis results reveal that the receiver’s ability, negative emotion, trust in government, and age influence personal mitigation behavior, personal adaptation, public mitigation, and public adaptation, respectively. As this study demonstrates the differences in the factors influencing each type of response actions against PM, evidence-based policy is needed that considers the differences in these influencing factors.

Taking a Stand to Remedy the Inadequacies of Action on Health Equity Exposed by COVID-19
Abstract: 
 As we struggle with the impacts of a global pandemic, there is growing evidence of the inequitable impacts of this crisis. In this commentary, we argue that actions on health equity to date have been insufficient despite significant scholarship to guide both practice and policy. To move from talk to action on health equity, we propose the following five approaches: (1) reversing the erosion of publicly funded health systems; (2) creating broad economic means to support health; (3) moving health action upstream; (4) challenging ageist and/or ableist discourses; and (5) decolonizing approaches and enacting solidarity. Engaging in these actions will help close the gaps and address disparities made more evident during this global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic reinforces the need for us to move from discussion to action if we are to achieve health for all. Adopting a health equity lens is a means of both understanding and stimulating action to readdress the root causes of inequities and work toward a fairer, more just society.

Sense of Agency for Mental Actions: Insights from a Belief-Based Action-Effect Paradigm
Abstract: 
 A substantial body of research in the past few decades has converged on the idea that the so-called “sense of agency”, the feeling of being in control of our own actions, arises from the integration of multiple sources of information at different levels. In this study, we investigated whether a measurable sense of agency can be detected for mental actions, without the contribution of motor components. We used a fake action-effect paradigm, where participants were led to think that a motor action or a particular thought could trigger a sound. Results showed that the high-level sense of agency, measured through explicit reports, was of comparable strength for motor and mental actions. The ‘intentional binding’ effect, a phenomenon typically associated with the experience of agency, was also observed for both motor and mental actions, with the only exception of short action-effect delays. Furthermore, a consistent relationship between explicit reports of agency and intentional binding was found. Taken together, our results provide novel insights into the specific role of intentional cues in instantiating a sense of agency, even in the absence of motor signals. These results may have important implications for future brain-computer interfaces as well as for the study of pathological disruptions of agency.

Transforming the stories we tell about climate change: From 'issue' to 'action
Abstract: 
 By some counts, up to 98% of environmental news stories are negative in nature Implicit in this number is the conventional wisdom among many communicators that increasing people's understanding, awareness, concern or even fear of climate change are necessary precursors for action and behavior change In this article we review scientific theories of mind and brain that explain why this conventional view is flawed In real life, the relationship between beliefs and behavior often goes in the opposite direction: our actions change our beliefs, awareness and concerns through a process of self-justification and self-persuasion As one action leads to another, this process of self-persuasion can go hand in hand with a deepening engagement and the development of agency - knowing how to act One important source of agency is learning from the actions of others We therefore propose an approach to climate communication and storytelling that builds people's agency for climate action by providing a wide variety of stories of people taking positive action on climate change Applied at scale, this will shift the conceptualization of climate change from 'issue-based' to 'action-based' It will also expand the current dominant meanings of 'climate action' (i e 'consumer action' and 'activism') to incorporate all relevant practices people engage in as members of a community, as professionals and as citizens We close by proposing a systematic approach to get more reference material for action-based stories from science, technology and society to the communities of storytellers - learning from health communication and technologies developed for COVID-19 © 2020 The Author(s) Published by IOP Publishing Ltd
