Real-Time, Direct Classification of Nanopore Signals with SquiggleNet
Abstract: 
 Single-molecule sequencers made by Oxford Nanopore provide results in real time as DNA passes through a nanopore and can eject a molecule after it has been partly sequenced. However, the computational challenge of deciding whether to keep or reject a molecule in real time has limited the application of this capability. We present SquiggleNet, the first deep learning model that can classify nanopore reads directly from their electrical signals. SquiggleNet operates faster than the DNA passes through the pore, allowing real-time classification and read ejection. When given the amount of sequencing data generated in one second, the classifier achieves significantly higher accuracy than base calling followed by sequence alignment. Our approach is also faster and requires an order of magnitude less memory than approaches based on alignment. SquiggleNet distinguished human from bacterial DNA with over 90% accuracy across test datasets from different flowcells and sample preparations, generalized to unseen species, and identified bacterial species in a human respiratory meta genome sample.

SAINT: automatic taxonomy embedding and categorization by Siamese triplet network
Abstract: 
 Motivation Understanding the phylogenetic relationship among organisms is the key in contemporary evolutionary study and sequence analysis is the workhorse towards this goal. Conventional approaches to sequence analysis are based on sequence alignment, which is neither scalable to large-scale datasets due to computational inefficiency nor adaptive to next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Alignment-free approaches are typically used as computationally effective alternatives yet still suffering the high demand of memory consumption. One desirable sequence comparison method at large-scale requires succinctly-organized sequence data management, as well as prompt sequence retrieval given a never-before-seen sequence as query. Results In this paper, we proposed a novel approach, referred to as SAINT, for efficient and accurate alignment-free sequence comparison. Compared to existing alignment-free sequence comparison methods, SAINT offers advantages in two aspects: (1) SAINT is a weakly-supervised learning method where the embedding function is learned automatically from the easily-acquired data; (2) SAINT utilizes the non-linear deep learning-based model which potentially better captures the complicated relationship among genome sequences. We have applied SAINT to real-world datasets to demonstrate its empirical utility, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Considering the extensive applicability of alignment-free sequence comparison methods, we expect SAINT to motivate a more extensive set of applications in sequence comparison at large scale. Availability The open source, Apache licensed, python-implemented code will be available upon acceptance. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

SARS-Cov-2 RNA Sequence Classification Based on Territory Information
Abstract: 
 CovID-19 genetics analysis is critical to determine virus type,virus variant and evaluate vaccines. In this paper, SARS-Cov-2 RNA sequence analysis relative to region or territory is investigated. A uniform framework of sequence SVM model with various genetics length from short to long and mixed-bases is developed by projecting SARS-Cov-2 RNA sequence to different dimensional space, then scoring it according to the output probability of pre-trained SVM models to explore the territory or origin information of SARS-Cov-2. Different sample size ratio of training set and test set is also discussed in the data analysis. Two SARS-Cov-2 RNA classification tasks are constructed based on GISAID database, one is for mainland, Hongkong and Taiwan of China, and the other is a 6-class classification task (Africa, Asia, Europe, North American, South American\&Central American, Ocean) of 7 continents. For 3-class classification of China, the Top-1 accuracy rate can reach 82.45\% (train 60\%, test=40\%); For 2-class classification of China, the Top-1 accuracy rate can reach 97.35\% (train 80\%, test 20\%); For 6-class classification task of world, when the ratio of training set and test set is 20\% : 80\% , the Top-1 accuracy rate can achieve 30.30\%. And, some Top-N results are also given.

Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data
Abstract: 
 Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. Further, we develop a suite of interpretability tools and show that it can be applied also to other models beyond the host prediction task. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect regions of interest in novel agents, for example, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. All methods presented here are implemented as easy-to-install packages not only enabling analysis of NGS datasets without requiring any deep learning skills, but also allowing advanced users to easily train and explain new models for genomics.

PACIFIC: a lightweight deep-learning classifier of SARS-CoV-2 and co-infecting RNA viruses
Abstract: 
 Viral co-infections occur in COVID-19 patients, potentially impacting disease progression and severity. However, there is currently no dedicated method to identify viral co-infections in patient RNA-seq data. We developed PACIFIC, a deep-learning algorithm that accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 and other common RNA respiratory viruses from RNA-seq data. Using in silico data, PACIFIC recovers the presence and relative concentrations of viruses with > 99% precision and recall. PACIFIC accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections in 63 independent in vitro cell culture and patient datasets. PACIFIC is an end-to-end tool that enables the systematic monitoring of viral infections in the current global pandemic.
