 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver donation and transplantation: A review of the literature 
Abstract: 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has upended healthcare systems worldwide and led to an inevitable decrease in liver transplantation (LT) activity. During the first pandemic wave, administrators and clinicians were obliged to make the difficult decision of whether to suspend or continue a life-saving procedure based on the scarce available evidence regarding the risk of transmission and mortality in immunosuppressed patients. Those centers where the activity continued or was heavily restricted were obliged to screen donors and recipients, design COVID-safe clinical pathways, and promote telehealth to prevent nosocomial transmission. Despite the ever-growing literature on COVID-19, the amount of high-quality literature on LT remains limited. This review will provide an updated view of the impact of the pandemic on LT programs worldwide. Donor and recipient screening, strategies for waitlist prioritization, and posttransplant risk of infection and mortality are discussed. Moreover, a particular focus is given to the possibility of donor-to-recipient transmission and immunosuppression management in COVID-positive recipients.

Title: 
 The importance of bedside echocardiographic assessment in emergency admissions with probable acute coronary syndromes: A case of an unruptured giant ascending aorta aneurysm. 
Abstract: 
Summary- Symptomatic aortic aneurysms can manifest in different clinical settings, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute heart failure, a shock that is mostly due to the complications related to dissection or rupture of the aneurysm. In these clinical settings, the diagnosis can be established with the help of medical history, physical examination, and promptly performed imaging tests. However, the diagnosis of an asymptomatic aortic aneurysm is usually incidental. Thus, it is very rare to find a case of ACS with intact aortic aneurysm and without obstructive coronary artery disease. In this paper, we report a successfully treated male patient aged 41 years with intact ascending aortic aneurysm who presented with ACS and was diagnosed with the help of bedside echocardiographic assessment.

 How Do Older Age, Gender and Risk Groups Affect Protective Behaviors and Mental Health in the COVID-19 Pandemic? 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND COVID-19 infection is severe in the presence of older age, male gender and risk factors. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the the level of anxiety created by immensely spreading COVID-19 related information and age, gender, and the presence of risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS The data used in this study was obtained by collecting a 25-question questionnaire created through google forms with various communication tools. RESULTS The data of 929 people who answered the questionnaire were used. The level of anxiety increased with age significantly, upon hearing that a person from their age group was harmed by the virus (p <0.001). The feelings of being depressed and hopeless significantly increased as the age increased (p <0.001). There was no significant difference between the genders in terms of feeling depressed and feeling of lack of joy in life (p = 0.066, p = 0.308, respectively). Participants with chronic diseases stated that they felt more depressed and hopeless and a lack of joy in life more frequently (p <0.001). CONCLUSION Our results indicated that individuals with older age and having risk factors were more vulnerable to the stress caused by the pandemic. It is necessary for healthcare providers to identify high-risk groups by considering this situations, in order to make early psychological interventions.

Title: 
 Developing outcome measures of disease activity in Pediatric Myasthenia. 
Abstract: 
INTRODUCTION Pediatric myasthenia encompasses juvenile myasthenia gravis (JMG) and congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) which are chronic disorders with fluctuating symptoms amenable to medical therapy. Disease activity and treatment response may be difficult to assess but unlike adults outcome measures have not been developed in children. METHODS The study was performed in children (0-18 years) at the neuromuscular center of a pediatric hospital over a 3-year period. Patients were recruited prospectively as part of their routine clinical care. Demographic data, diagnosis (JMG/CMS), and the following scales were recorded at each visit: Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America class (MGFA), Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and Pediatric Myasthenia Quality of Life 15(PM-QOL15). RESULTS 33 patients (24 JMG, 9 CMS) were included in the study, 22 had two or more visits. We established known-groups validity of the MGC and PM-QOL15 scores as compared to the MGFA class. To establish concurrent validity, we constructed a ROC curve and calculated threshold values of MGC and PM-QOL15 with optimal sensitivity and specificity for identifying a patient with more severe (MGFA III or higher) disease. Finally, we demonstrated the concordance between the MGC and PM-QOL15 by their statistically significant positive Pearson's and Spearman correlations. DISCUSSION Our study suggests that MGC and PM-QOL15 are important disease outcome measures in pediatric myasthenia that are easy to administer and provide reliable assessment of disease activity in the clinic setting. Further studies are needed to validate their use for pediatric clinical research trials. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Title: 
 Tomographic findings in bronchial atresia 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate computed tomography (CT) findings in 23 patients with bronchial atresia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT images were reviewed by two radiologists who reached decisions by consensus. We included only patients who presented with abnormalities on CT and in whom the diagnosis had been confirmed by pathological examination of the surgical specimen (if the lesion was resected). The CT scans were assessed in order to identify the main findings and to map the distribution of the lesions (i.e., to determine whether the pulmonary involvement was unilateral or bilateral). RESULTS: The main CT finding was the combination of bronchocele and hyperinflation of the distal lung. That combination was observed in all of the patients. The lesions were unilateral in all 23 cases, being seen predominantly in the left upper lobe, followed by the right lower lobe, right upper lobe, middle lobe, and left lower lobe. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of bronchial atresia can be reliably made on the basis of a finding of bronchocele accompanied by hyperinflation of the adjacent lung parenchyma.
