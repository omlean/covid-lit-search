Title: 
 Adsorption kinetics and Box-Behnken design optimization for organic dyes on tungsten oxide. 
Abstract: 
Transition metal oxides have been applied to degrade organic dyes found in water bodies via photocatalysis. To do it, however, is essential that the dye molecules adsorb onto the metal oxide surface. Thus, optimizing the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent increases the probability of reaction between oxidation radicals and organic dye molecules and maximizes the effectiveness per gram of photocatalyst. With this in mind, we studied the adsorption behavior of Methylene Blue (MB) and Acid Orange 7 (AO7), two commonly found pollutants, as a function of dilution's pH, WO3 load, and initial dye concentration. We found out that WO3 adsorbs up to 80% of MB at pH=6, and 13% of AO7 at pH=2, although it is unable to adsorb AO7 at the natural pH of the dye dilution. Assuming a pseudo-second order kinetics model for the analysis of the MB adsorption amount, we determined a rate constant k2 = 6 × 10-2(g · mg-1)/min for the adsorption process. We put forward a molecular model for adsorption, driven by concentration gradients and electrostatic interactions. Finally, from a statistical analysis, we determined that pH is the most significant factor for the adsorption of MB and AO7 on WO3, reinforcing the notion that electrostatic interactions are the main mechanism driving the adsorption process. The Box-Behnken design optimization also evinces the key playing role of WO3 load in the adsorption percentage of AO7 and let us establish the optimal load required to maximize adsorption.

 Effective Medical Lecturing: Practice Becomes Theory: A Narrative Review 
Abstract: 
Effective lecturing stimulates learning, creates a verbal history for our profession, and is a central basis for evaluating academic promotion. Unfortunately, few resources exist in the medical literature to guide the academician toward success as an effective lecturer. Using evidence-based principles, this review fosters adult learning in academic venues by incorporating the latest innovations in educational theory for both online and traditional teaching. The novice or advanced academic teacher will be guided toward critical self-evaluation of current teaching practices and encouraged to replace ineffective methods with ones more likely to be both rewarding and rewarded. By introducing literature-based learning techniques, emphasizing audience targeting, truncating content to an appropriate level of detail, effectively linking images and text, and accepting the brevity of learners’ attentiveness, we show that the audience, not the speaker, is the primary educational focus.

Title: 
 A four-year observational study to examine the dietary impact of the North Carolina Healthy Food Small Retailer Program, 2017–2020 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: The North Carolina (NC) Healthy Food Small Retailer Program (HFSRP) was passed into law with a $250,000 appropriation (2016–2018) providing up to $25,000 in funding to small food stores for equipment to stock healthier foods and beverages. This paper describes an observational natural experiment documenting the impact of the HFSRP on store food environments, customers’ purchases and diets. METHODS: Using store observations and intercept surveys from cross-sectional, convenience customer samples (1261 customers in 22 stores, 2017–2020; 499 customers in 7 HFSRP stores, and 762 customers in 15 Comparison stores), we examined differences between HFSRP and comparison stores regarding: (1) change in store-level availability, quality, and price of healthy foods/beverages; (2) change in healthfulness of observed food and beverage purchases (“bag checks”); and, (3) change in self-reported and objectively-measured (Veggie Meter®-assessed skin carotenoids) customer dietary behaviors. Differences (HFSRP vs. comparison stores) in store-level Healthy Food Supply (HFS) and Healthy Eating Index-2010 scores were assessed using repeated measure ANOVA. Intervention effects on diet were assessed using difference-in-difference models including propensity scores. RESULTS: There were improvements in store-level supply of healthier foods/beverages within 1 year of program implementation (0 vs. 1–12 month HFS scores; p = 0.055) among HFSRP stores only. Comparing 2019 to 2017 (baseline), HFSRP stores’ HFS increased, but decreased in comparison stores (p = 0.031). Findings indicated a borderline significant effect of the intervention on self-reported fruit and vegetable intake (servings/day), though in the opposite direction expected, such that fruit and vegetable intake increased more among comparison store than HFSRP store customers (p = 0.05). There was no significant change in Veggie Meter®-assessed fruit and vegetable intake by customers shopping at the intervention versus comparison stores. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvement in healthy food availability, there was a lack of apparent impact on dietary behaviors related to the HFSRP, which could be due to intervention dose or inadequate statistical power due to the serial cross-sectional study design. It may also be that individuals buy most of their food at larger stores; thus, small store interventions may have limited impact on overall eating patterns. Future healthy retail policies should consider how to increase intervention dose to include more product marketing, consumer messaging, and technical assistance for store owners.

 Estimating the impact of interventions against COVID-19: from lockdown to vaccination 
Abstract: 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease of humans caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the first case was identified in China in December 2019 the disease has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic. In this article, we present a detailed agent-based model of COVID-19 in Luxembourg, and use it to estimate the impact, on cases and deaths, of interventions including testing, contact tracing, lockdown, curfew and vaccination. Our model is based on collation, with agents performing activities and moving between locations accordingly. The model is highly heterogeneous, featuring spatial clustering, over 2000 behavioural types and a 10 minute time resolution. The model is validated against COVID-19 clinical monitoring data collected in Luxembourg in 2020. Our model predicts far fewer cases and deaths than the equivalent equation-based SEIR model. In particular, with $R_0 = 2.45$, the SEIR model infects 87% of the resident population while our agent-based model results, on average, in only around 23% of the resident population infected. Our simulations suggest that testing and contract tracing reduce cases substantially, but are much less effective at reducing deaths. Lockdowns appear very effective although costly, while the impact of an 11pm-6am curfew is relatively small. When vaccinating against a future outbreak, our results suggest that herd immunity can be achieved at relatively low levels, with substantial levels of protection achieved with only 30% of the population immune. When vaccinating in midst of an outbreak, the challenge is more difficult. In this context, we investigate the impact of vaccine efficacy, capacity, hesitancy and strategy. We conclude that, short of a permanent lockdown, vaccination is by far the most effective way to suppress and ultimately control the spread of COVID-19.
