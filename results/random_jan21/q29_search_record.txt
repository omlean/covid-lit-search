 A comparative study of Bot Detection techniques methods with an application related to Covid-19 discourse on Twitter 
Abstract: 
Bot Detection is an essential asset in a period where Online Social Networks(OSN) is a part of our lives. This task becomes more relevant in crises, as the Covid-19 pandemic, where there is an incipient risk of proliferation of social bots, producing a possible source of misinformation. In order to address this issue, it has been compared different methods to detect automatically social bots on Twitter using Data Selection. The techniques utilized to elaborate the bot detection models include the utilization of features as the tweets metadata or the Digital Fingerprint of the Twitter accounts. In addition, it was analyzed the presence of bots in tweets from different periods of the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic, using the bot detection technique which best fits the scope of the task. Moreover, this work includes also analysis over aspects regarding the discourse of bots and humans, such as sentiment or hashtag utilization.

 Sequence Analysis of 20,453 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Genomes from the Houston Metropolitan Area Identifies the Emergence and Widespread Distribution of Multiple Isolates of All Major Variants of Concern 
Abstract: 
Since the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there has been international concern about the emergence of virus variants with mutations that increase transmissibility, enhance escape from the human immune response, or otherwise alter biologically important phenotypes. In late 2020, several variants of concern emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), the South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California variants of interest (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. On the basis of our extensive genome sequencing program involving 20,453 coronavirus disease 2019 patient samples collected from March 2020 to February 2021, we report identification of all six of these SARS-CoV-2 variants among Houston Methodist Hospital (Houston, TX) patients residing in the greater metropolitan area. Although these variants are currently at relatively low frequency (aggregate of 1.1%) in the population, they are geographically widespread. Houston is the first city in the United States in which active circulation of all six current variants of concern has been documented by genome sequencing. As vaccine deployment accelerates, increased genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understanding the presence, frequency, and medical impact of consequential variants and their patterns and trajectory of dissemination.

 Factors influencing mHealth adoption and its impact on mental well-being during COVID-19 pandemic: A SEM-ANN approach. 
Abstract: 
The objectives of this study are to examine the factors affecting the intention and actual usage behavior on mHealth adoption, investigate the effect of actual usage behavior of mHealth on mental wellbeing of the end-users, and investigate the moderating role of self-quarantine on the intention-actual usage of mHealth under the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic situation. The required primary data were gathered from the end-users of mHealth in Bangladesh. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, this study has confirmed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and facilitating conditions have a positive influence on behavioral intention whereas health consciousness has an impact on both intention and actual usage behavior. mHealth usage behavior has an affirmative and meaningful effect on the mental well-being of the service users. Moreover, self-quarantine has strong influence on actual usage behavior but does not moderate the intention-behavior relationship. In addition, due to the existence of a non-linearity problem in the data set, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was engaged to sort out relatively significant predictors acquired from Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). However, this study contributes to the emergent mHealth literature by revealing how the use of the mHealth services elevates the quality of patients' mental well-being under this pandemic situation.

 Comparison of DASS-21, PHQ-8, and GAD-7 in a virtual behavioral health care setting 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Validated depression and anxiety symptom screeners are commonly used in clinical settings. How results from different brief depression and anxiety symptom assessment tools compare to each other is not well established, especially in real world healthcare settings. This study aimed to compare the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 Depression scale (DASS-Depression) and Anxiety (DASS-Anxiety) scale to the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) respectively, in a real-world virtual behavioral healthcare setting. METHODS: This was a retrospective comparison study of clinical data from a population of adults who completed a consultation via telephone or secure video with a licensed therapist as part of a standardized, evidence-based, virtual behavioral therapy program for individuals with comorbid medical and behavioral health conditions. The joint distributions and correlations between scores yielded by each depression and anxiety scale were assessed using descriptive and Spearman correlation statistics. RESULTS: The DASS-Depression and PHQ-8 were highly correlated (r = .71; p=<.001); the DASS-Anxiety and GAD-7 correlation was also high (r = .61; p=<.001). The PHQ-8 categorized more individuals as having above-threshold depression scores versus the DASS-Depression (71.5% vs. 43.5%; p < .001). The GAD-7 categorized more individuals as having above-threshold anxiety scores versus the DASS-Anxiety (59.0% vs. 45.0%; p < .001). LIMITATIONS: This study compared results yielded by validated screeners, precluding conclusions related to the validity of screener results. CONCLUSIONS: The DASS-Depression and PHQ-8 and the DASS-Anxiety and GAD-7 similarly ranked symptom severity. The PHQ-8 and GAD-7 were more likely than the DASS-21 Depression or Anxiety scales to classify individuals as having above-threshold symptom severity.

 Public Perspectives on Anti-Diabetic Drugs: Exploratory Analysis of Twitter Posts 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a major global public health issue where self-management is critical to reducing disease burden. Social media has been a powerful tool to understand public perceptions. Public perception of the drugs used for the treatment of diabetes may be useful for orienting interventions to increase adherence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the public perceptions of anti-diabetic drugs through the analysis of health-related tweets mentioning such medications. METHODS: This study uses an infoveillance social listening approach to monitor public discourse using Twitter data. We coded 4000 tweets from January 1, 2019 to October 1, 2019 containing key terms related to anti-diabetic drugs by using qualitative content analysis. Tweets were coded for whether they were truly about an anti-diabetic drug and whether they were health-related. Health-related tweets were further coded based on who was tweeting, which anti-diabetic drug was being tweeted about, and the content discussed in the tweet. The main outcome of the analysis was the themes identified by analyzing the content of health-related tweets on anti-diabetic drugs. RESULTS: We identified 1664 health-related tweets on 33 anti-diabetic drugs. A quarter (415/1664) of the tweets were confirmed to have been from people with diabetes, 17.9% (298/1664) from people posting about someone else, and 2.7% (45/1664) from health care professionals. However, the role of the tweeter was unidentifiable in two-thirds of the tweets. We identified 13 themes, with the health consequences of the cost of anti-diabetic drugs being the most extensively discussed, followed by the efficacy and availability. We also identified issues that patients may conceal from health care professionals, such as purchasing medications from unofficial sources. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses an infoveillance approach using Twitter data to explore public perceptions related to anti-diabetic drugs. This analysis gives an insight into the real-life issues that an individual faces when taking anti-diabetic drugs, and such findings may be incorporated into health policies to improve compliance and efficacy. This study suggests that there is a fear of not having access to anti-diabetic drugs due to cost or physical availability and highlights the impact of the sacrifices made to access anti-diabetic drugs. Along with screening for diabetes-related health issues, health care professionals should also ask their patients about any nonâ€“health-related concerns regarding their anti-diabetic drugs. The positive tweets about dietary changes indicate that people with type 2 diabetes may be more open to self-management than what the health care professionals believe.
