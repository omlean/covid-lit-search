 Factors associated with stress, anxiety, and depression during social distancing in Brazil 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of clinical signs and symptoms of severe/extreme stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as their associated factors, among Brazilians during social distancing METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in April/May 2020 with 3,200 Brazilians over 18 years old Respondents' sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using an online questionnaire, which also included the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess emotional symptoms Unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios and their respective 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression models with robust variance RESULTS: Our results show the prevalence of severe/extreme stress was 21 5%, anxiety 19 4%, and depression 21 5% In the final model, sociodemographic, clinical, and Covid-19-related factors were associated with severe/extreme stress, anxiety, and depression in Brazilians during social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic We found the main factors associated with severe/extreme depression to be young women, brown, single, not religious, sedentary, presenting reduced leisure activities, history of anxiety and depression, increased medication use, and Covid-19 symptoms CONCLUSION: This study may help develop and systematically plan measures aimed to prevent, early identify, and properly manage clinical signs and symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression during the Covid-19 pandemic

Title: 
 Success and complications of endotracheal intubation in critical care settings under COVID-19 protocols 
Abstract: 
INTRODUCTION: The Covid-19 pandemic has required new protocols for endotracheal intubation mandating cumbersome personal protective equipment and modifications to prior intubation procedures. We assessed the success and complications of endotracheal intubation under such protocols. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of endotracheal intubation in the emergency department, intensive care unit, or ward between September 11, 2018 and June 11, 2020 at two urban hospitals. Using a standardized form, we included basic demographics, intubation techniques, and success, and pre-specified complications, defined as critical (cardiac arrest or failure to intubate) or non-critical. At both sites, Covid-19 intubation protocols took effect on March 11, 2020, and we compared pre-post patients. The primary outcome was first-pass success without complications. Secondary outcomes included first-pass success and complications. We analysed by descriptive techniques. RESULTS: Overall, we collected 1534 patients before March 11, 2020 and 227 after; groups were similar in age and sex distribution. Staff endotracheal intubation increased from 37 to 63%. First pass success was 1262/1534 (82.3%) pre versus 195/227 (85.9%) post, for a difference of 3.6% (95% CI - 1.8-8.0%). First pass success without complications was 1116/1534 (72.8%) pre versus 168/227 (74.0%) post, for a difference of 1.3%, (95% CI - 5.2-7.0%). There were 226 complications pre (14.7%) versus 47 (20.7%) post, for a difference of 6.0%. (95% CI 0.6-12.1%). CONCLUSIONS: New pandemic endotracheal intubation protocols did not result in a decrease in first-pass success, or first-pass success without complications.

Title: 
 Perception among ophthalmologists about webinars as a method of continued medical education during COVID-19 pandemic 
Abstract: 
PURPOSE: To ascertain ophthalmologist‘s perceptions about webinars as a method of continued medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, a 21-question survey was circulated using digital media platform to approximately 1400 ophthalmologists in India between 16(th) August 2020 to 31(st) August 2020. The questionnaire focussed on the quality and usefulness of webinars based on the Bloom‘s taxonomy. The responses (on 4- or 5-point Likert scale) were analyzed among three professional groups- ophthalmologists in-training, consultants in public sector, and private practitioners. RESULTS: 393 ophthalmologists participated in the survey, with a response rate of 28%. The mean age was 34.6 ± 9.7 years, and males constituted 49.6% (199/393) of the respondents. Forty-seven percent of the respondents perceived the quality of webinars as good or excellent (185/393), 72.8% reported knowledge gain from webinars (286/393), and 63.9% felt that webinars are important in clinical practice and should continue post-COVID-19 pandemic (251/393), with distinct responses among the professional groups. The drawbacks perceived were overt number of webinars (371; 94.4%), confusion regarding which webinars to attend (313; 79.6%), repetition of the information (296; 75.3%), limited opportunity for participant interaction (146; 37.2%) and disparate weightage to the core disciplines of Ophthalmology. CONCLUSION: Most respondents had favorable perceptions of Ophthalmology webinars happening during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is need for improvisation in the volume of webinars, target-audience-based delivery, and participant interaction to add value to this new dimension of teaching-learning.
