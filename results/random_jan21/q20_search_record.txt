 Medical Education for What?: Neoliberal Fascism Versus Social Justice 
Abstract: 
In her 2018 book, What the Eyes Don’t See, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha wrote that it is the duty of doctors to speak out against injustice. In fact, no other physician or institution in Flint had done the research and spoken out, as a whistleblower, against the poisoning of Flint’s children by Michigan government. Why had Dr. Hannah-Attisha? Unfortunately, in the absence of a medical education system that teaches community-oriented primary health care in the tradition of the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration, there is little reward in doing so. This article focuses on three movements that are challenging medical education orthodoxy: 1) primary health care 2) the medical humanities and 3) “Study Up your Town” medicine. How can we create a radical health pedagogy – one that draws the links between several pandemics raging across the planet: capitalist collapse, climate disruption, Covid-19, racism, and an emergent neoliberal fascism – to enable doctors, health professionals and citizens to see them as all of one piece? Medical educators must employ critical pedagogy to create legions of “constructive troublemakers” who challenge the social-structural obstacles that are driving millions to premature death. We have reached the “end times.” A new “planet medicine” is finally emerging.

 Antiviral Essential Oil Components Against SARS-CoV-2 in Pre-procedural Mouth Rinses for Dental Settings During COVID-19: A Computational Study 
Abstract: 
COVID-19 mainly spreads through cough or sneeze droplets produced by an infected person. The viral particles are mostly present in the oral cavity. The risk of contracting COVID-19 is high in the dental profession due to the nature of procedures involved that produce aerosols. Along with other measures to limit the risk of infection, pre-procedural mouth rinses are beneficial in reducing the viral particles in the oral cavity. In this study, the antiviral efficacy of essential oil components has been determined specifically against SARS-CoV-2 by molecular docking and conceptual DFT approach. Based on the binding affinities of the components against the receptor binding domain of the S1 glycoprotein, cuminal, carvacrol, myrtanol, and pinocarveol were found to be highly active. The molecular descriptor values obtained through conceptual DFT also indicated the above-mentioned components to be active based on the correlation between the structure and the activity of the compounds. Therefore, pre-procedural mouth rinses with these components included may be specifically suitable for dental procedures during the COVID-19 period.

 Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the residency programs of the country: A multicentre study 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE: To provide an insight on the disruption of multiple facets of residency programs in a multi-centre study. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out by enrolling the available residents from three teaching hospitals of the country by sending a questionnaire through email. The questionnaire comprised of three parts; 1) basic demographics, 2) effect on multiple facets of training and 3) the use of smart learning with the support provided by the hospitals. Data collection was started during the first week of June 2020 after acquiring ethical approval from the concerned department and the total duration of the study was one month. Data was analysed using SPSS v. 19.0. RESULTS: A hundred-and-five completed responses were obtained with a response rate of 42%. Fifty-nine percent of the participants were female residents. Majority of the residents (69%) belonged to the age group 25-30 years. Fourth year residents (38%) showed maximum participation and the mean number of work days per month were 22±5.4. All of the aspects of training suffered complete or severe reduction except for the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings, elective rotations and e-log book entries. Sixty seven to sixty-nine percent of the residents felt complete clinical, educational and psychological desertion in their departments, 59% used telemedicine and 90% reported non-availability of smart learning facilities. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the clinical skills, teaching and personal growth of many trainees. There is a decrease in exposure to almost all of the aspects of training with no alternative in the form of smart learning provided to many. Clinical, educational and psychological support, although an extremely important part of healthcare staffing and management, has been largely neglected as well.
