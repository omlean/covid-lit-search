 Targeting SARS‐CoV‐2 viral proteases as a therapeutic strategy to treat COVID‐19 
Abstract: 
The 21st century has witnessed three outbreaks of coronavirus (CoVs) infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)‐CoV, and SARS‐CoV‐2. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), caused by SARS‐CoV‐2, spreads rapidly and since the discovery of the first COVID‐19 infection in December 2019, has caused 1.2 million deaths worldwide and 226,777 deaths in the United States alone. The high amino acid similarity between SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 viral proteins supports testing therapeutic molecules that were designed to treat SARS infections during the 2003 epidemic. In this review, we provide information on possible COVID‐19 treatment strategies that act via inhibition of the two essential proteins of the virus, 3C‐like protease (3CL(pro)) or papain‐like protease (PL(pro)).

 How Our Neanderthal Genes Affect the COVID-19 Mortality: Iran and Mongolia, Two Countries with the Same SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Cluster but Different Mortality Rates 
Abstract: 
Neanderthal genes possibly gave modern human protection against viruses. However, a recent study revealed that that a long sequence of DNA that is inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors can be linked to severe COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. Substantial evidence now indicates that our genetic background may be involved in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the rapid progress of COVID-19 in some infected individuals. Although both morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 strongly depends on key factors such as age and co-existing health conditions, potential classes of human genomic variants possibly affect the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its progress. Despite Iran and Mongolia seem to share the same SARS-CoV-2 mutation cluster, the COVID-19 mortality rates in these two countries are drastically different. While the population in Iran is 25.8 times higher than that of Mongolia, the number of confirmed cases is 1170 times higher. Moreover, the death rate shows a drastic difference. Since Neanderthals interbred with modern humans in Middle East between 47,000 and 65,000 years ago before going extinct 40,000 years ago, some Iranians have much more Neanderthal DNA than other people. Although neither genetic background nor environmental factors alone can determine our risk of developing severe COVID-19, our genes clearly affect both the development and progression of infectious diseases including COVID-19. Given these considerations, we believe that these great differences, at least to some extent, can be due to the proportion of Neanderthal genes among the people of these two countries

 Appealing to the Gut Feeling: How Intermittent Fasters Choose Information Tab Interfaces for Information Acquisition 
Abstract: 
Although many deem intermittent fasting (IF) a healthy dietary regimen, there is a paucity of scientific evidence to corroborate IF health benefits in human studies. However, its comparative ease and the emphasized benefits in the light of COVID-19 (e.g., weight loss and immunization improvement) have led to the increase of IF adoption. A vast number of intermittent fasters have not sought consultation from health professionals, which can bring adverse health effects. Most intermittent fasters use mobile apps to get assistance for IF. Types of assistance offered by the IF mobile applications may range from tracking (e.g., fasting periods, calorie intake) to obtaining knowledge about IF. However, it is unclear how much people are using the features for learning more about IF which is crucial to making healthier decisions in the IF adoption process. Thus, we organized our study into two stages for establishing design implications that further encourage a safety-conscious and user-friendly IF experience. We first investigated how IF app users who have chosen apps that provide extensive IF-specific knowledge acquire the said knowledge via (i) topic modeling of user app reviews, (ii) detecting modularity in co-word maps drawn from reviews specific to IF information acquisition, (iii) locating the position of keywords indicating information acquisition in the reviews. Then, we examined how users judge the effectiveness of knowledge provision interfaces in obtaining information. We investigated this aspect with an interface ranking user task for information tabs and organized user rationale using manual coding and co-word mapping.

 COVID-19 Under Origin and Transmission: A Data-Driven Analysis for India and Bangladesh 
Abstract: 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an exceptionally contagious and pathogenic viral disease brought about by the SARS-CoV-2 infection that was first detailed at Wuhan, China, and later it spreads everywhere throughout the world It was a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like virus, and the primary host of this virus is bats, revealed through genome analysis The intermediate medium between human and bats is still unknown, and it is quite contagious, resulting in rapid spreading of this disease All things considered, there are no clinically endorsed medications or antibodies for this sickness, yet a few precautions and staying away from close contacts are suggested The number of COVD-19 confirmed cases is rapidly increasing with higher mortality rates, more than other epidemics that occurred in the last century although it still fluctuates We will analyze the COVID-19 outbreak situation considering confirmed cases, recoveries, mortality rate percentages, etc India and Bangladesh are two geographically important countries, and we will also analyze the COVID-19 situation for these two countries either with similarities or differences © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG
