Title: 
 Multidrug treatment for COVID-19. 
Abstract: 
An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which began in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization characterized the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) as a pandemic in March 2020. In the absence of specific treatments for the virus, treatment options are being examined. Drug repurposing is a process of identifying new therapeutic uses for approved drugs. It is an effective strategy to discover drug molecules with new therapeutic indications. This strategy is time-saving, low-cost, and has a minimal risk of failure. Several existing approved drugs such as chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline, azithromycin, and ivermectin are currently in use because of their efficacy in inhibiting COVID-19. Multidrug therapy, such as a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, a combination of doxycycline and ivermectin, or a combination of ivermectin, doxycycline, and azithromycin, has been successfully administered. Multidrug therapy is efficacious because the mechanisms of action of these drugs differ. Moreover, multidrug therapy may prevent the emergence of drug-resistant SARS-CoV-2.

Title: 
 ECMO in COVID-19-prolonged therapy needed? A retrospective analysis of outcome and prognostic factors. 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND The role of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) in patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) still remains unclear. Our aim was to investigate the clinical course and outcome of those patients and to identify factors associated with the need for prolonged ECMO therapy. METHODS A retrospective single-center study on patients with VV ECMO for COVID-19-associated ARDS was performed. Baseline characteristics, ventilatory and ECMO parameters, and laboratory and virological results were evaluated over time. Six months follow-up was assessed. RESULTS Eleven of 16 patients (68.8%) survived to 6 months follow-up with four patients requiring short-term (<28 days) and seven requiring prolonged (⩾28 days) ECMO support. Lung compliance before ECMO was higher in the prolonged than in the short-term group (28.1 (28.8-32.1) ml/cmH2O vs 18.7 (17.7-25.0) ml/cmH2O, p = 0.030). Mechanical ventilation before ECMO was longer (19 (16-23) days vs 5 (5-9) days, p = 0.002) and SOFA score was higher (12.0 (10.5-17.0) vs 10.0 (9.0-10.0), p = 0.002) in non-survivors compared to survivors. Low viral load during the first days on ECMO tended to indicate worse outcomes. Seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2 occurred in all patients, but did not affect outcome. CONCLUSIONS VV ECMO support for COVID-19-induced ARDS is justified if initiated early and at an experienced ECMO center. Prolonged ECMO therapy might be required in those patients. Although no relevant predictive factors for the duration of ECMO support were found, the decision to stop therapy should not be made dependent of the length of ECMO treatment.

Title: 
 Generation and manipulation of human iPSC-derived platelets 
Abstract: 
The discovery of iPSCs has led to the ex vivo production of differentiated cells for regenerative medicine. In the case of transfusion products, the derivation of platelets from iPSCs is expected to complement our current blood-donor supplied transfusion system through donor-independent production with complete pathogen-free assurance. This derivation can also overcome alloimmune platelet transfusion refractoriness by resulting in autologous, HLA-homologous or HLA-deficient products. Several developments were necessary to produce a massive number of platelets required for a single transfusion. First, expandable megakaryocytes were established from iPSCs through transgene expression. Second, a turbulent-type bioreactor with improved platelet yield and quality was developed. Third, novel drugs that enabled efficient feeder cell-free conditions were developed. Fourth, the platelet-containing suspension was purified and resuspended in an appropriate buffer. Finally, the platelet product needed to be assured for competency and safety including non-tumorigenicity through in vitro and in vivo preclinical tests. Based on these advancements, a clinical trial has started. The generation of human iPSC-derived platelets could evolve transfusion medicine to the next stage and assure a ubiquitous, safe supply of platelet products. Further, considering the feasibility of gene manipulations in iPSCs, other platelet products may bring forth novel therapeutic measures.

Title: 
 Zika virus-like particle vaccine protects AG129 mice and rhesus macaques against Zika virus 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is a re-emerging virus that constitutes a public health threat due to its recent global spread, recurrent outbreaks, and infections that are associated with neurological abnormalities in developing fetuses and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. To date, there are no approved vaccines against ZIKV infection. Various preclinical and clinical development programs are currently ongoing in an effort to bring forward a vaccine for ZIKV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We have developed a ZIKV vaccine candidate based on Virus-Like-Particles (VLPs) produced in HEK293 mammalian cells using the prM (a precursor to M protein) and envelope (E) structural protein genes from ZIKV. Transient transfection of cells via plasmid and electroporation produced VLPs which were subsequently purified by column chromatography yielding approximately 2mg/L. Initially, immunogenicity and efficacy were evaluated in AG129 mice using a dose titration of VLP with and without Alhydrogel 2% (alum) adjuvant. We found that VLP with and without alum elicited ZIKV-specific serum neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and that titers correlated with protection. A follow-up immunogenicity and efficacy study in rhesus macaques was performed using VLP formulated with alum. Multiple neutralization assay methods were performed on immune sera including a plaque reduction neutralization test, a microneutralization assay, and a Zika virus Renilla luciferase neutralization assay. All of these assays indicate that following immunization, VLP induces high titer nAbs which correlate with protection against ZIKV challenge. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These studies confirm that ZIKV VLPs could be efficiently generated and purified. Upon VLP immunization, in both mice and NHPs, nAb was induced that correlate with protection against ZIKV challenge. These studies support translational efforts in developing a ZIKV VLP vaccine for evaluation in human clinical trials.

 Comprehensive Review of Cardiovascular Involvement in COVID-19. 
Abstract: 
COVID-19 has emerged as one of the most devastating and clinically significant infectious diseases of the last decade. It has reached global pandemic status at an unprecedented pace and has placed significant demands on health care systems worldwide. Although COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, epidemiologic reports have shown that the disease affects other vital organs of the body, including the heart, vasculature, kidneys, brain, and the hematopoietic system. Of importance is the emerging awareness of the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. The current state of knowledge regarding cardiac involvement in COVID-19 is presented in this article, with particular focus on the cardiovascular manifestations and complications of COVID-19 infection. The mechanistic insights of disease causation and the relevant pathophysiology involved in COVID-19 as they affect the heart are explored and described. Relevant practice essentials and clinical management implications for patients with COVID-19 with a cardiac pathology are presented in light of recent evidence.
