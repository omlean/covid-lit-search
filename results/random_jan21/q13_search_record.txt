 COVID-19 and Heart Transplant: A Case Series and Review of the Literature 
Abstract: 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in many challenges in patient care, especially among high-risk populations such as heart transplant recipients. Patients with heart transplant experience a significantly higher mortality rate with COVID-19 infection, and management is based on extrapolation from clinical trials done on nontransplant patients and from clinical experience. Here we report 4 cases of patients with heart transplant who presented with COVID-19 infection in late 2020. Patients presented with symptoms similar to those seen in the general population. All 4 patients were admitted to the hospital, and they were all treated with dexamethasone. In addition, 2 patients received remdesivir. Immunosuppressive medications were adjusted to maintain adequate levels of immunosuppression but at the same time allow for an adequate immune response against the infection. All patients were discharged alive from the hospital. We then performed a literature review on studies that included heart transplant patients who developed the infection and developed suggestions for a standardized management approach, which we share in this article.

 Leveraging theories in instructional design: a reflective response to OLSit framework 
Abstract: 
This paper is in response to the article entitled A Design Framework for Enhancing Engagement in Student-Centered Learning: Own It, Learn It, and Share (Lee and Hannafin in Educat Technol Res Develop 64(4):707–734, 2016). In this article, the authors proposed a theoretical framework to provide guidelines for promoting engagement in student-centered learning (SCL) based on relevant principles from different learning theories and empirical research findings. This framework connects learning theories with instructional design practices, providing theory-based instructional strategies and methods for improving student engagement in SCL. Challenges of applying this framework include customization issues, time, and resource constraints. More case examples of solving different instructional problems with this theoretical framework would help stakeholders understand how to use this framework in different contexts.

Title: 
 ARE GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH POORER OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19? 
Abstract: 
ABSTRACT Background: The prognosis of patients with COVID-19, with older age and comorbidities, is associated with a more severe course and higher fatality rates but no analysis has yet included factors related to the geographical area/municipality in which the affected patients live. So the objective of this study is to analyse the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in terms of sex, age, comorbidities, and geographic variables. Methods: A retrospective cohort of 6286 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was analysed, considering demographic data, previous comorbidities and geographic variables. The main study variables were hospital admission, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and death due to worsening symptoms; and the secondary variables were sex, age, comorbidities and geographic variables (size of the area of residence, distance to the hospital and the driving time to the hospital). A comparison analysis and a multivariate Cox model were performed. Results: The multivariate Cox model showed that women had a better prognosis in any type of analysed prognosis. Most of the comorbidities studied were related to a poorer prognosis except for dementia, which is related to lower admissions and higher mortality. Suburban areas were associated with greater mortality and with less hospital or ICU admission. Distance to the hospital was also associated with hospital admission. Conclusions: Factors such as type of municipality and distance to hospital act as social health determinants. This fact must be taken account in order to stablish specifics prevention measures and treatment protocols.

Title: 
 The Study of Students’ Opinion on Learning Online in the Self-Isolation Period 
Abstract: 
The threat of the spread of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) gave rise to serious difficulties in the organisation of the students’ study process Reactions of Higher Education Establishments to COVID-19 pandemic were various: from no response to the threat to the strategy of complete social isolation at home and rapid changes of the study programs in order to adapt them to the online mode of education A lot of questions, which needed close consideration and making quick decisions, arose The most urgent and important question was: what methods and forms of education to use in the period of COVID-19 pandemic, which ones will be the most effective? Another important issue was the attitude of the students to the studies online? What problems and difficulties will they come across during the time of self-isolation? The aim of the given research is the study of the peculiarities of the new study process mode, the difficulties and problems that students come across The research was conducted by the teaching staff of the Chair of Humanities in the Transport and Telecommunication Institute The empiric method was used The questionnaire was compiled and offered to students The authors offer several recommendations which are aimed at the improvement of the study process in the changing conditions The knowledge of the problems and the difficulties which the students face will help the teaching staff to adapt the existing teaching practice to an online frame, and proceeding from the experience we have acquired during the self-isolation period, to improve the existing methods and to introduce new methods how to support the students in self-guided learning, which approach to choose and how to facilitate collaboration We sincerely hope that the results of our research might be interesting and useful for other Institutions of Higher Learning © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG
