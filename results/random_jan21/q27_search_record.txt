Title: 
 COVID-19 in Portugal: predictability of hospitalization, ICU and respiratory-assistance needs. 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND In face of the current SARS-COV-2 pandemic, the timely prediction of upcoming medical needs for infected individuals enables a better and quicker care provision when necessary and management decisions within health care systems. OBJECTIVE This work aims to predict medical needs (hospitalizations, ICU admission, respiratory assistance) and survivability of individuals testing SARS-CoV-2 positive using a retrospective cohort with 38.545 infected individuals in Portugal during 2020. METHODS Predictions of medical needs are performed using state-of-the-art machine learning approaches at various stages of a patient's cycle, namely: testing time (pre-hospitalization), post-hospitalization, and post-intensive care. A thorough optimization of state-of-the-art predictors is undertaken to assess the ability to anticipate medical needs and infection outcomes using demographic and comorbidity variables, as well as onset date of symptoms, test and hospitalization. RESULTS For the target cohort, 75% of hospitalization needs can be identified at the SARS-CoV-2 testing time and over 60% respiratory needs at hospitalization time, both with >50% precision. CONCLUSIONS The conducted study pinpoints the relevance of the proposed predictive models as good candidates to support medical decisions for the Portuguese population, including both monitoring and in-hospital care decisions. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) is further provided to this end. CLINICALTRIAL

Title: 
 The effects of psychological intervention on anxiety symptoms of COVID19-positive patients isolated in hospital wards. 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE The study aimed to explore the effects of psychological intervention on alleviating anxiety in patients in novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) isolation wards. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 24th, 2020 and March 5th, 2020, 103 patients were studied. Among these, 32 were patients in the isolation ward of the Infectious Disease Department in Baoding Second Hospital with suspected 2019-nCoV, and 71 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV were in the Tangshan Infectious Disease Hospital. Of the 103 patients included, 97 cases were observed in isolation. Using a self-control study design, each patient's anxiety was scored on a self-rating anxiety scale before receiving the psychological intervention (on the 7th day of isolation) and after receiving the intervention (on the 14th day of isolation). The severity of anxiety was evaluated based on the anxiety score before receiving the intervention. The anxiety scores before and after receiving the intervention were then compared using the paired t-test, and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS After receiving the psychological intervention once or twice a week, the anxiety of the patients improved significantly after one week. CONCLUSIONS The anxiety of patients with 2019-nCoV in isolation wards can be alleviated through psychological intervention. By alleviating patient anxiety, this intervention also helps patients maintain their psychological wellbeing, which promotes rehabilitation and helps with the control of 2019-nCoV.
