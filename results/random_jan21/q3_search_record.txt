 DeepCoroNet: A deep LSTM approach for automated detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images 
Abstract: 
The new coronavirus, known as COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, and since then has been transmitted to the whole world Around 34 million people have been infected with COVID-19 virus so far, and nearly 1 million have died as a result of the virus Resource shortages such as test kits and ventilator have arisen in many countries as the number of cases have increased beyond the control Therefore, it has become very important to develop deep learning-based applications that automatically detect COVID-19 cases using chest X-ray images to assist specialists and radiologists in diagnosis In this study, we propose a new approach based on deep LSTM model to automatically identify COVID-19 cases from X-ray images Contrary to the transfer learning and deep feature extraction approaches, the deep LSTM model is an architecture, which is learned from scratch Besides, the Sobel gradient and marker-controlled watershed segmentation operations are applied to raw images for increasing the performance of proposed model in the pre-processing stage The experimental studies were performed on a combined public dataset constituted by gathering COVID-19, pneumonia and normal (healthy) chest X-ray images The dataset was randomly separated into two sections as training and testing data For training and testing, these separations were performed with the rates of 80%–20%, 70%–30% and 60%–40%, respectively The best performance was achieved with 80% training and 20% testing rate Moreover, the success rate was 100% for all performance criteria, which composed of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and F-score Consequently, the proposed model with pre-processing images ensured promising results on a small dataset compared to big data Generally, the proposed model can significantly improve the present radiology based approaches and it can be very useful application for radiologists and specialists to help them in detection, quantity determination and tracing of COVID-19 cases throughout the pandemic

 Relative versus absolute RNA quantification: a comparative analysis based on the example of endothelial expression of vasoactive receptors 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: In the present study, two distinct PCR methods were used for the quantification of genetic material and their results were compared: real-time-PCR (qPCR; relative quantification) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR; absolute quantification). The comparison of the qPCR and the ddPCR was based on a stimulation approach of microvascular endothelial cells in which the effect of a pro-inflammatory milieu on the expression of vasoactive receptors was investigated. RESULTS: There was consistency in directions of effects for the majority of genes tested. With regard to the indicated dimension of the effects, the overall picture was more differentiated. It was striking that deviations were more pronounced if the measured values were on the extreme edges of the dynamic range of the test procedures. CONCLUSIONS: To obtain valid and reliable results, dilution series are recommended, which should be carried out initially. In case of ddPCR the number of copies per µl should be adjusted to the low three-digit range. With regard to qPCR it is essential that the stability and reliability of the reference genes used is guaranteed. Here, ddPCR offers the advantage that housekeeping genes are not required. Furthermore, an absolute quantification of the sample can be easily performed by means of ddPCR. Before using ddPCR, however, care should be taken to optimize the experimental conditions. Strict indications for this methodology should also be made with regard to economic and timing factors.

 Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric dental attendance 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on dental attendance and emergency/non-emergency visits of children during the outbreak, compared to the same period of 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who visited the paediatric department clinic during the observed period were included in this study. The patient’s demographic data, purpose of visit, and treatment type were evaluated retrospectively from patient examination records. The Pearson chi-square and t-tests were used for comprehensive statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1454 patient files (1184/270 cases from non-pandemic/pandemic period) were assessed. A significant reduction was found in aggregated emergency/non-emergency visits during the pandemic period (p < 0.01). During the pandemic, average daily visits for emergency dental care were observed to have a decrease to half of the non-pandemic period. Non-emergency routine dental visits have also exhibited a drastic decline. Severe dental pain due to pulpal inflammation and abscess/swelling were the most frequently reported urgent dental complaints that patients applied to the paediatric dental clinic during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has a significant influence on patients’ attendance to paediatric dental clinic. Therefore, concerning a potential post-pandemic increase in treatment demand, meticulous future planning and proper regulation of dental care should be provided for better oral health and children’s quality of life. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study’s importance is the observation of dramatically reduced number of patient visits during the pandemic period which may yield increased number of oral health-related complications in the long run.

 History of the Asian Society of Cardiovascular Imaging 
Abstract: 
The Asian Society of Cardiovascular Imaging (ASCI) was established in 2006 to improve the healthcare, education, training, quality control, and research in cardiovascular imaging in Asia. The ASCI is presently active, with more than 1400 members from 53 countries. Herein, the evolution and current development of the ASCI are described, including the early history, organization, annual congresses, collaboration with international sister societies, official journal, and the ASCI School. The ASCI has successfully led the development of cardiovascular imaging in Asia and will continue to grow.
