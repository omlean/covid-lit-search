Title: 
 Self-weighing Practices and Associated Health Behaviors during COVID-19. 
Abstract: 
Objective: In this study, we investigated self-weighing frequency (SWF) among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and retrospectively (6 months) before the pandemic, and whether SWF was associated with changes in health-related behaviors. Methods: United States adults (N = 1607) completed a health-related questionnaire during COVID-19 and associated shelter-in-place. We categorized respondents into 4 groups of SWF at the time of the pandemic: "Never," "< 1x a week," "1x a week," or "> 1x a week." Results: The proportion of adults never weighing increased during the pandemic (15% to 25%), whereas the proportion of those weighing < 1x week went down (41% to 29%). Higher SWF was significantly associated with changes in energy expenditure including increased total physical activity (PA), lower likelihood of decreases in vigorous, moderate, and walking PA, and a lower likelihood of sitting more. More frequent self-weighing also was associated statistically with lower likelihood of keeping unhealthy eating behaviors the same. Conversely, there was no significant difference in changes in alcohol, caffeine, takeout, fruit or vegetable consumption, and television viewing among SWF groups. Conclusion: SWF decreased during the pandemic in the lower 2 SWF categories. Higher SWF was associated with fewer negative changes in health behaviors, especially related to PA.

Title: 
 Variations in health behaviors among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic 
Abstract: 
PURPOSE: To examine changes in lifestyle behaviors early in the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional internet-based survey was completed by 706 pregnant women (mean age 29.6 years ± 3.2) residing in the United States in May 2020 to assess self-reported changes in diet, physical activity, and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses examined whether sociodemographic, clinical, and pandemic-related characteristics were associated with health behavior changes. RESULTS: Approximately 17% of women reported their diets worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic, 42% reported improvements, and 41% reported no change. For physical activity, 22% reported they stopped being active, 2% reported they became active, and 76% reported no change. Nearly one-third of participants reported getting less sleep. The factors consistently associated with adverse lifestyle changes (worse diet, stopped being active, and reduced sleep) were experiences of pregnancy complications, loss of income due to COVID-19, and changes in social connections due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of pregnant women reported adverse lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions during the pandemic to optimize health behaviors in pregnant women, especially among those with pregnancy complications, should address economic disadvantages and social support.

Title: 
 Proximity to international airports and early transmission of COVID-19 in the United States-An epidemiological assessment of the geographic distribution of 490,000 cases 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Identifying hotspots in a pandemic is essential for early containment. In the context of the rapid global dissemination of the Covid-19 pandemic, describing viral infection rates in relation to international air travel early during the pandemic can help inform future public health policy. The objective of this study is to determine whether proximity to an international airport predicted higher infection rates during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States (US). METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, the authors examined the incidence of Covid-19 in areas near US international airports in the first weeks after detection of Covid-19 in all 50 states, using publicly available county-level incidence of Covid-19 data. They performed a multiple regression to determine the relative effects of population density and air traffic in the Counties Containing Airports (CCA) and the number of Covid-19 cases, and determined the odds of Covid-19 in CCA compared to the rest of the state. RESULTS: Multiple regression analysis revealed that air traffic was significantly correlated with Covid-19 cases during the initial phase of pandemic while population density was not significantly correlated. Three weeks into the pandemic, the pooled odds of Covid-19 cases in CCA was 2.66 (95% CI [2.64, 2.68], p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The counties in the US containing international airports represented initial hotspots for Covid-19 transmission. Early public health containment efforts focused on these areas may help mitigate disease transmission during future similar novel respiratory virus epidemics.

Title: 
 Influence of the characteristics of the house and place of residence in the daily educational activities of children during the period of COVID-19’ confinement 
Abstract: 
The period of confinement motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic and established by the governments of different countries has influenced the lifestyle of millions of children, not being able to continue carrying out multiple educational activities as they did until confinement The objective of this research was to determine and analyze whether the living conditions of children during the period of confinement caused by COVID-19 influenced their daily educational activities A descriptive, comparative and cross-sectional quantitative study with a non-experimental design was carried out, with a single measurement in a single group Factors associate with living conditions were analyzed, such as the place of residence and the type of house in which Spanish children have been confined, as well as the number and use of technological devices The parents' perception of the children's state of fatigue, happiness, energy and tiredness was also analyzed We have worked with a sample of 837 Spanish children As a data collection instrument, the validated questionnaire on Equipment and Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Households (TIC-H2019) of the National Statistics Institute (INE) was used, following the recommendations of the Statistical Office of the European Union (EUROSTAT) The results confirm some statistically significant influence of the conditions of the house and place of residence on the daily time dedicated to different educational activities such as reading, physical activity, free play or use of technological devices between children residing in small flats and those residing in large flats or houses with garden and those residing in urban and rural settings © 2021 Life style;Education;Children;COVID-19 © 2021

Title: 
 Applying Laplace Adomian decomposition method (LADM) for solving a model of Covid-19. 
Abstract: 
In this study, we apply the Laplace Adomian decomposition method (LADM) for the mathematical model of Covid-19. The mathematical model includes a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Therefore, the model cannot be solved analytically but only by approximation. The application of LADM approximates the solution profiles of the dynamical variables of the Covid-19 model by an analytical power series. The conventional way to calculate the expressions of the approximation solutions is complicated both in terms of mathematical calculations and in terms of computer run time. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for implementing the LADM method combined with the singularly perturbed vector field (SPVF) method. The new algorithm we offer is significantly reducing the running time of both the computer and the mathematical calculations. We compared the results obtained from the LADM to the numerical simulations. Some plots are presented to show the reliability and simplicity of the new algorithm.
