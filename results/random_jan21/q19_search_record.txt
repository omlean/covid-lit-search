 COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: can iloprost have a role for the treatment? 
Abstract: 
Pulmonary infection of 2019-nCoV can frequently induce acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (pO2/FiO2) of less than 300 mmHg. Moreover, it can be complicated with cardiac injury or arrhythmia, microvascular and large-vessel thrombosis. We describe a case of a patient with COVID19-ARDS and concomitant critical ischemia of the limbs. Iloprost treatment, an analogue of a prostacyclin PGI2, was started for residual left forefoot ischemia after surgical thromboembolectomy. Unexpectedly, we documented improvement of respiratory performance and lung high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed significant regression of the diffuse pulmonary ground-glass opacity. The hypothetical mechanism is that iloprost can enhance perfusion preferentially to well-ventilated lung regions, reduce pressures of peripheral pulmonary vessels and induce reduction of lung interstitial edema. In addition, iloprost antithrombotic effect, endothelial damage repairing and neo-angiogenesis activity could play a relevant role.

 Molecular and Cellular Biomarkers of COVID-19 Prognosis: Protocol for the Prospective Cohort TARGET Study 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world’s attention has been focused on better understanding the relation between the human host and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as its action has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. OBJECTIVE: In this context, we decided to study certain consequences of the abundant cytokine release over the innate and adaptive immune systems, inflammation, and hemostasis, comparing mild and severe forms of COVID-19. METHODS: To accomplish these aims, we will analyze demographic characteristics, biochemical tests, immune biomarkers, leukocyte phenotyping, immunoglobulin profile, hormonal release (cortisol and prolactin), gene expression, thromboelastometry, neutralizing antibodies, metabolic profile, and neutrophil function (reactive oxygen species production, neutrophil extracellular trap production, phagocytosis, migration, gene expression, and proteomics). A total of 200 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction–confirmed patients will be enrolled and divided into two groups: mild/moderate or severe/critical forms of COVID-19. Blood samples will be collected at different times: at inclusion and after 9 and 18 days, with an additional 3-day sample for severe patients. We believe that this information will provide more knowledge for future studies that will provide more robust and useful clinical information that may allow for better decisions at the front lines of health care. RESULTS: The recruitment began in June 2020 and is still in progress. It is expected to continue until February 2021. Data analysis is scheduled to start after all data have been collected. The coagulation study branch is complete and is already in the analysis phase. CONCLUSIONS: This study is original in terms of the different parameters analyzed in the same sample of patients with COVID-19. The project, which is currently in the data collection phase, was approved by the Brazilian Committee of Ethics in Human Research (CAAE 30846920.7.0000.0008).

Title: 
 Efficient maternofetal transplacental transfer of anti- SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies after antenatal SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination 
Abstract: 
Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during pregnancy and early infancy can result in severe disease. Evaluating the serologic response after maternal vaccination during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer has important implications for maternal care and vaccination strategies. Objective To assess maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after antenatal mRNA vaccination. Design, Setting, and Participants This study took place at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel in February 2021. Maternal and cord blood sera were collected for antibody measurement from mother/newborn dyads following antenatal vaccination. Exposure SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Main outcome and measures Spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD)- specific, IgG levels were evaluated in maternal and cord blood sera. Results The study cohort consisted of 20 parturients, with a median maternal age of 32 years and a median gestational age of 393/7 weeks at the time of delivery. The median time lapsed from the first and second doses of vaccine administration until delivery was 33 [IQR 30-37] and 11 [IQR 9-15] days, respectively. Of the 20 dyads, all women and infants were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG levels in maternal sera were positively correlated to their respective concentrations in cord blood (Rs= 0.72; P<0.001 and Rs = 0.72; P <0.001, respectively). Anti-S and anti-RBD-specific IgG titers in cord blood were directly correlated with time lapsed since the administration of the first vaccine dose (Rs = 0.71; P =0.001 and Rs= 0.63; P=0.004, respectively). Conclusion and Relevance In this study, SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine administered during pregnancy induced adequate maternal serologic response with subsequent efficient transplacental transfer. Our findings highlight that vaccination of pregnant women may provide maternal and neonatal protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Title: 
 Opportunities for Radiology Trainee Education Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons From an Academic Breast Imaging Program 
Abstract: 
The COVID-19 pandemic required restructuring of Radiology trainee education across US institutions. While reduced clinical imaging volume and mandates to maintain physical distancing presented new challenges to traditional medical education during this period, new opportunities developed to support our division in providing high-quality training for residents and fellows. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Core Competencies for Diagnostic Radiology helped guide division leadership in restructuring and reframing breast imaging education during this time of drastic change and persistent uncertainty. Here, we reflect on the educational challenges and opportunities faced by our academic breast imaging division during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic across each of the ACGME Core Competencies. We also discuss how systems and processes developed out of necessity during the first peak of the pandemic may continue to support radiology training during phased reopening and beyond.

Title: 
 Computational Fluidic Modeling of a Low-Cost Fluidic Oscillator for Conversion of a CPAP Machine into an Emergency Use Mechanical Ventilator 
Abstract: 
This paper presents the computational fluidic modeling of a fluidic oscillator for the conversion of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines into emergency pressure support mechanical ventilators by providing a periodic pressure output to patients. The design addresses potential ventilator shortages resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or future pandemics by converting a positive pressure source into a mechanical ventilator with a part that is (i) inexpensive, (ii) easily manufactured without the need for specialized equipment, (iii) simple to assemble and maintain, (iv) does not require any electronics, and (v) has no moving components that could be prone to failure. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is used to assess flow characteristics of the system, and a prototype is developed and tested with a commercial benchtop respiratory stimulator. The simulations show clinically relevant periodic oscillation with outlet pressures in the range of 8-20 cmH2O and end-user-tunable frequencies in the range of 3-6 seconds (respiratory rate (RR) of 10-20 breaths per minute). The prototype can respond to disrupted oscillations, an analogue for patient-initiated breaths. The fluidic oscillator presented here functions at physiologically-relevant pressures and frequencies, demonstrating potential as a low-cost, readily deployable means for converting CPAP machines into emergency use ventilators.
