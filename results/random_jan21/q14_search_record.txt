Title: 
 Aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps occlude Meibomian glands during ocular surface inflammation. 
Abstract: 
PURPOSE Obstructive Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is one of the leading causes of evaporative dry eye disease. Meibomian glands at the eyelid secrete lipids that prevent evaporation of the aqueous tear film. The pathogenesis of obstructive MGD is incompletely understood to date. Herein, we aim to investigate the pathogenesis of obstructive MGD using murine and human samples with various forms of ocular surface inflammation. METHOD The presence of Neutrophil extracellular Traps (NETs) was detected with immunofluorescence analysis of ocular surface discharge and biopsy samples from patients with blepharitis. Tear fluid from patients with MGD and blepharitis were evaluated for the presence of inflammatory mediators using bead based immunoassay. Murine model of allergic eye disease (AED) was performed to investigate the role of NETs in MG occlusion. RESULTS we show that the ocular discharge from patients with blepharitis contains aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps (aggNETs). Furthermore, the ducts of human Meibomian glands affected by blepharitis were largely congested by aggNETs. Tear fluid from patients with MGD showed elevated neutrophil chemoattractants (C5a, IL6, IL8 and IL18). C5a and IL8 correlated with the degree of deficiency of tear fluid. In the murine model of allergic eye disease (AED), aggNETs accumulated in the MG leading to occlusion of their ducts and the retrograde pent-up of the fluid followed by acinar atrophy. Constraining aggNET formation by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of peptidyl arginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) effectively reduced MG damage. CONCLUSION We conclude that aggNETs occlude MG causing MGD after ocular surface inflammation.

Title: 
 Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, and Dexamethasone Repurposed for COVID-19: a Comprehensive Clinical and Pharmacovigilant Reassessment 
Abstract: 
In this manuscript, we discuss the expectations versus the real-world results of four repurposed COVID-19 drugs: tocilizumab, remdesivir, favipiravir, and dexamethasone from a clinical and pharmacovigilant point of view. We suggest that though the results of two-phase III double-blind clinical trials have been less than expected, tocilizumab has a real remaining potential to treat selected critical cases of COVID-19 beyond clinical trials until more data are revealed. On the contrary, remdesivir, though its FDA approval, and favipiravir are least likely to benefit COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we recommend that the RECOVERY dexamethasone should only be considered for critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients and we urge physicians in developing countries to avoid using it in mild-moderate COVID-19 cases. Finally, we recommend considering a personalized risk-benefit ratio before a decision is made using any of these drugs.

Title: 
 Childhood Adversity and Perceived Distress from the COVID-19 Pandemic 
Abstract: 
Childhood exposure to adversity may increase an individual’s reactivity to subsequent stressors. In this paper, we examine how adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with experiencing greater perceived distress during the pandemic. In this volunteer clinical cohort study, 177 pregnant women (ages 16–38) were recruited from two university-affiliated perinatal clinics located in a small metropolitan city between October 2017 and May 2018. Longitudinal data collection is ongoing. The current study includes the 101 women who participated through the eighth and most recent survey conducted in mid-April 2020. OLS regression analyses were used to examine the association between childhood adversity and pandemic-related distress. We found that ACE scores were associated with higher levels of distress (b = .08; se = .03; p < .01) when controlling for demographic characteristics. The addition of loneliness to the model fully mediates the association between ACEs score and distress. Findings suggest that adverse childhood experiences influence COVID-19-related distress due to greater social isolation. Those who had greater adversity during childhood may be less likely to have the social connectedness needed to reduce distress due to the pandemic.

Title: 
 Lessons from Contact Tracing in Mid-Missouri. 
Abstract: 
The public health community has used contact tracing to address pandemics since the eighteenth century. With the emergence of COVID-19, these classical skills are the primary defense for communities to limit morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. Here we describe the methods, strengths, and challenges of contact tracing.

Title: 
 Self-management and adherence to recommended follow-up after gynaecological cancer: results from the international InCHARGE study. 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE To assess the relationship between self-management skills and adherence to follow-up guidelines among gynecological cancer survivors in the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark, and to assess the relationship between adherence to follow-up programs and use of additional healthcare services. METHODS For this international, multicenter, cross-sectional study, we recruited gynecological cancer survivors 1-5 years after completion of treatment. Information on follow-up visits, use of healthcare resources, self-management (measured by the Health Education Impact Questionnaire), clinical characteristics, and demographics were obtained by validated questionnaires. Participants were categorized as adherent if they attended the number of follow-up visits recommended by national guidelines, non-adherent if they had fewer visits than recommended, or over-users if they had more visits than recommended. RESULTS Of 4455 invited survivors, 2428 (55%) returned the questionnaires, and 911 survivors were included in the analyses. Survivors with high self-management most frequently adhered to recommended follow-up. Non-adherent survivors showed lower self-management in the health-directed activity domain (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.32) than adherent survivors. No other associations between self-management and follow-up adherence were revealed. Non-adherent survivors tended to have endometrial cancer, surgical treatment only, be older, and be Danish residents. Over-users reported more follow-up visits and also used additional healthcare services more frequently than adherent survivors. CONCLUSION Low self-management appears to reduce the likelihood of adherence to national guidelines for gynecological cancer follow-up. Focusing on patient education for survivors at risk of low self-management to ensure adherence to recommended follow-up may improve personalization of follow-up.
