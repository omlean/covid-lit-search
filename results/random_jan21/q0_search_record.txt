 Direct Simulation of the CoVid-19 epidemic 
Abstract: 
We introduce an agent-based model to simulate the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19. Most computational models proposed to study this epidemic do no take into account human mobility. We present a direct simulation model where mobility plays a key role and propose as well four quarantine strategies. The results show that the no-quarantine strategy does lead to a high peak of contagions with no rebound. Quarantined strategies, for their part, show a re-emergence of the epidemic with smaller and softer peaks.

Title: 
 Multi-scale semi-analytical model for fatigue life prediction of trans-tibial prosthetic sockets. 
Abstract: 
The trans-tibial socket is an essential component of the prosthesis that connects it to the residual limb. Socket misalignments and permanent deformations reduce the comfort of the amputee. In order to forestall such issues, sufficient information about the socket lifespan needs to be acquired, which is fairly difficult given the lack of calculation methods that estimate the fatigue life in the literature. In this paper a semi-analytical model is proposed based on experimental results. It highlights the effects of the amputee average daily walking time on the socket fatigue life. A proportionality relationship is demonstrated linking the Burgers model parameters at the structural scale to those at the macroscopic scale. Hence, it becomes possible to evaluate the permanent deformation that induces a misalignment in the socket. These results are useful for the designers to predict the fatigue life of the socket, and also for clinicians to monitor the mechanical degradation of the trans-tibial socket and schedule maintenance or replacement.

 Why COVID-19 is not so spread in Africa: How does Ivermectin affect it? 
Abstract: 
Background: Scientists have so far been unable to determine the reason for the low number of COVID-19 cases in Africa. Objective: To evaluate the impact of ivermectin interventions for onchocerciasis on the morbidity, mortality, recovery, and fatality rates caused by COVID-19. Method: A retrospective statistical analysis study of the impact of ivermectin against COVID-19 between the 31 onchocerciasis-endemic countries using the community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) and the non-endemic 22 countries in Africa. The morbidity, mortality, recovery rate, and fatality rate caused by COVID-19 were calculated from the WHO situation report in Africa. We investigated the onchocerciasis endemic 31 countries and the non-endemic 22 countries. Statistical comparisons used by the Welch test of them in the two groups were made. Results: The morbidity and mortality were statistically significantly less in the 31 countries using CDTI. The recovery and fatality rates were not statistically significant difference. The average life expectancy was statistically significantly higher in the non-endemic countries. Conclusions: The morbidity and mortality in the onchocerciasis endemic countries are lesser than those in the non-endemic ones. The community-directed onchocerciasis treatment with ivermectin is the most reasonable explanation for the decrease in morbidity and fatality rate in Africa. In areas where ivermectin is distributed to and used by the entire population, it leads to a significant reduction in mortality.

Title: 
 Racial Equity as a Human Rights Issue: Field Agency Practices and Field Instructors’ Knowledge and Attitudes 
Abstract: 
Racial equity which, at minimum, is defined as the state in which health, social, and economic outcomes are no longer predicted by race has become a critical issue for social workers who work with and advocate for the rights of marginalized communities. Despite its importance, it remains to be seen if field instructors and the agencies they work for understand racial equity as a human rights issue. Through an anonymous survey, we assessed field instructor’s racial equity awareness, knowledge, and understanding and examined actions agencies have taken to address and advance racial equity. It was hypothesized that field instructors who view racial equity as a human right would report promoting and advancing these important concepts with their students and organizations. A total of 170 field instructors accessed the survey through an emailed link in this exploratory effort. Descriptive analyses found that field instructors believe that racial equity is a significant human rights issue and that their agency’s culture views racial equity as important; however, issues with time, resources, funding, and expertise to promote racial equity initiatives create obstacles to bring about change. The discussion emphasizes the importance of building capacity among field educators to address racial equity through a human rights lens, which is integral to advancing the collective social work goals of social justice and dismantling systemic oppression.

Title: 
 Heparin-binding protein levels correlate with aggravation and multiorgan damage in severe COVID-19 
Abstract: 
Background: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may suffer persistent systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure, leading to a poor prognosis Research question: To examine the relevance of the novel inflammatory factor heparin-binding protein (HBP) in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and evaluate the correlation of the biomarker with disease progression Study design and methods: 18 critically ill COVID-19 patients who suffered from respiratory failure and sepsis, including 12 cases who experienced a rapidly deteriorating clinical condition and six cases without deterioration, were investigated They were compared with 15 age- and sex- matched COVID-19-negative patients with respiratory failure Clinical data were collected and HBP levels were investigated Results: HBP was significantly increased in critically ill COVID-19 patients following disease aggravation and tracked with disease progression HBP elevation preceded the clinical manifestations for up to 5 days and was closely correlated with patients' pulmonary ventilation and perfusion status Interpretation: HBP levels are associated with COVID-19 disease progression in critically ill patients As a potential mediator of disease aggravation and multiple organ injuries that are triggered by continuing inflammation and oxygen deficits, HBP warrants further study as a disease biomarker and potential therapeutic target
