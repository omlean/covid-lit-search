Title: 
 Post-lockdown abatement of COVID-19 by fast periodic switching 
Abstract: 
COVID-19 abatement strategies have risks and uncertainties which could lead to repeating waves of infection. We show—as proof of concept grounded on rigorous mathematical evidence—that periodic, high-frequency alternation of into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i) predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii) robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements over short time scales. In turn—while not eliminating the virus—this fast switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs associated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of 1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 days working, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based on measurements filtered over longer time scales. Our results highlight the potential efficacy of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdown mitigation. All code is available on Github at https://github.com/V4p1d/FPSP_Covid19. A software tool has also been developed so that interested parties can explore the proof-of-concept system.

 Prenatal Biochemical and Ultrasound Markers in COVID-19 Pregnant Patients: A Prospective Case-Control Study 
Abstract: 
This prospective observational study aimed to evaluate whether women with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first trimester of pregnancy are at higher risk of noninvasive prenatal screening test alterations and/or of congenital fetal anomalies at the second-trimester fetal anatomy scan. Maternal symptoms were secondly investigated. The study was carried out on 12-week pregnant women admitted for noninvasive prenatal testing (16 April and 22 June 2020). The cohort had seromolecular tests for SARS-CoV-2, after which they were divided into a positive case group and a negative control group. Both groups had 20-week ultrasound screening. Seventeen out of the 164 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (10.3%). There were no significant differences in mean nuchal translucency thickness or biochemical markers (pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, unconjugated estriol) between cases and controls (p = 0.77, 0.63, 0.30, 0.40, 0.28) or in the fetal incidence of structural anomalies at the second-trimester fetal anatomy scan (p = 0.21). No pneumonia or hospital admission due to COVID-19-related symptoms were observed. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first trimester of pregnancy did not predispose affected women to more fetal anomalies than unaffected women. COVID-19 had a favorable maternal course at the beginning of pregnancy in our healthy cohort.

Title: 
 A phenomenological study of the lived experience of nurses in the battle of COVID-19 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Roles and responsibilities of nurses are crucial in the battle of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but nursing duties also put them at risk for infections. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experience of nurses in combatting COVID-19 in Belitung, Indonesia. METHODS: This study employed a phenomenological study design. Online interviews and chatting were conducted among 17 clinical nurses who were purposively selected from March to June 2020. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and validated among researchers. The thematic approach was used for data analysis. FINDINGS: Seven themes emerged (1) feeling "nano-nano", (2) lack of N95 masks, (3) we are just pawns, (4) being rejected, (5) please do not spread our identity, (6) we miss home, and (7) feeling betrayed by regulation. DISCUSSION: Findings of this study should be used by government agencies, nurses, and the general population in combatting COVID-19.

Title: 
 Planetare Gesundheit – transformative Lehr- und Lernformate zur Klima- und Nachhaltigkeitskrise für Gesundheitsberufe 
Abstract: 
The urgency of the climate and sustainability crises and their health effects are receiving increasing attention in the German health system. To avoid further exacerbation of these crises, profound transformative processes in all sectors of society are needed (e.g. transport, energy production, and food systems). Based on the ethical imperative of non-maleficence and the high levels of trust in society, health professionals have great potential to make an important contribution to the necessary transformative processes. In order to fully harness this potential, health professionals should be supported in developing competencies to take transformative action during their pre- and postgraduate education and professional training. In this article, we introduce the concept of planetary health, as this concept provides orientation for this both ethically and with regards to the subject matter. Furthermore, we provide an overview of current teaching and learning formats and identify aspects that could contribute to further developing planetary health education.

Title: 
 Veränderung der psychischen Belastung in der COVID-19-Pandemie in Deutschland: Ängste, individuelles Verhalten und die Relevanz von Information sowie Vertrauen in Behörden 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health was evident early on. The extent of the effects, especially cumulative over the long period of the pandemic, has not yet been fully investigated for Germany. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine psychological burden as well as COVID-19-related experience and behavior patterns and to show how they changed during the different phases of the pandemic in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Germany-wide online-based cross-sectional study (03/10–07/27/2020) included 22,961 people (convenience sample). Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), and psychological distress (DT) were collected, as well as COVID-19-related experiences and behavior patterns: COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions, subjective level of information, adherent safety behavior, and personal risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness. The pandemic was retrospectively divided into five phases (initial, crisis, lockdown, reorientation, and new normality). RESULTS: Compared to pre-COVID-19 reference values, GAD‑7, PHQ‑2, and DT levels were significantly elevated and persistent throughout the different phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-related fear, information level, trust, safety behavior, and the risk assessment for infection/severe course of illness showed, after initial strong increase, a strong decrease to partly below the initial value. Exceptions were constant risk assessments of having a severe course of illness or dying of it. CONCLUSIONS: The increased levels of psychological burden, which have persisted throughout all phases of the pandemic, illustrate the need for sustainable support services. Declining values over the duration of the pandemic in terms of trust in governmental actions and the feeling of being well informed underline the need for more targeted education.
