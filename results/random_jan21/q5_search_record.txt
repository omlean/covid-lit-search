Title: 
 Individual Differences in Social Distancing and Mask-Wearing in the Pandemic of COVID-19: The Role of Need for Cognition, Self-control and Risk Attitude 
Abstract: 
In the United States, while the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase, the practice of social distancing and mask-wearing have been controversial and even politicized. The present study examined the role of psychological traits in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior and attitude. A sample of 233 U.S. adult residents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants completed scales of social distancing compliance, mask-wearing behavior and attitude, need for cognition, self-control, risk attitude, and political ideology. Epidemiological information (seven-day positive rate and the number of cases per 100,000) was obtained based on the state participants resided in. As a result, epidemiological information did not correlate with social distancing compliance mask-wearing. Political ideology, on the other hand, was a significant factor, with a more liberal tendency being associated with greater engagement in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior an attitude. Importantly, those who were more risk averse, or had a higher level of self-control or need for cognition practiced more social distancing and mask-wearing, after controlling for demographics, epidemiological information, and political ideology. Furthermore, for mask-wearing behavior, political ideology interacted with both need for cognition and self-control. Collectively, the study revealed the psychological roots of individual differences in social distancing and mask-wearing compliance.

Title: 
 Human milk banks in the response to COVID-19: a statement of the regional human milk bank network for Southeast Asia and beyond 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on infant feeding in the context of COVID-19 uphold standing recommendations for breastfeeding, non-separation, and skin-to-skin contact, including the use of donor human milk when mother's own milk is not available. INSUFFICIENT GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF DONOR HUMAN MILK AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN MILK BANKS IN THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE: COVID-19 clinical management guidelines in seven countries in Southeast Asia are not aligned with WHO recommendations despite the lack of evidence of transmission through either breastmilk or breastfeeding. The use of safe donor human milk accessed through human milk banks is also insufficiently recommended, even in countries with an existing human milk bank, leading to a gap in evidence-based management of COVID-19. This highlights long-standing challenges as well as opportunities in the safe, equitable, and resilient implementation of human milk banks in the region. CONCLUSIONS: This statement reflects the expert opinion of the Regional Human Milk Bank Network for Southeast Asia and Beyond on the need to revisit national guidelines based on the best evidence for breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, to incorporate human milk bank services in national obstetric and newborn care guidelines for COVID-19 where possible, and to ensure that operations of human milk banks are adapted to meet the needs of the current pandemic and to sustain donor human milk supply in the long-term. The Network also recommends sustained engagement with the global human milk bank community.

Title: 
 Discovery of potential inhibitors against New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 from natural compounds: in silico-based methods 
Abstract: 
New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase variants and different types of metallo-β-lactamases have attracted enormous consideration for hydrolyzing almost all β-lactam antibiotics, which leads to multi drug resistance bacteria. Metallo-β-lactamases genes have disseminated in hospitals and all parts of the world and became a public health concern. There is no inhibitor for New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 and other metallo-β-lactamases classes, so metallo-β-lactamases inhibitor drugs became an urgent need. In this study, multi-steps virtual screening was done over the NPASS database with 35,032 natural compounds. At first Captopril was extracted from 4EXS PDB code and use as a template for the first structural screening and 500 compounds obtained as hit compounds by molecular docking. Then the best ligand, i.e. NPC120633 was used as templet and 800 similar compounds were obtained. As a final point, ten compounds i.e. NPC171932, NPC100251, NPC18185, NPC98583, NPC112380, NPC471403, NPC471404, NPC472454, NPC473010 and NPC300657 had proper docking scores, and a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was performed for calculation binding free energy of each compound with New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase. Protein sequence alignment, 3D conformational alignment, pharmacophore modeling on all New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase variants and all types of metallo-β-lactamases were done. Quantum chemical perspective based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method was performed to discover conserved and crucial residues in the catalytic activity of metallo-β-lactamases. These residues had similar 3D coordinates of spatial location in the 3D conformational alignment. So it is posibble that all types of metallo-β-lactamases can inhibit by these ten compounds. Therefore, these compounds were proper to mostly inhibit all metallo-β-lactamases in experimental studies.

Title: 
 Efficacy and safety of Levamisole treatment in clinical presentations of non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: Levamisole has shown clinical benefits in the management of COVID-19 via its immunomodulatory effect. However, the exact role of Levamisole effect in clinical status of COVID-19 patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Levamisole on clinical status of patients with COVID-19 during their course of the disease. METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (room-air oxygen saturation > 94%) from late April 2020 to mid-August 2020. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 3-day course of Levamisole or placebo in combination with routine standard of care. RESULTS: With 25 patients in each arm, 50 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Most of the study participants were men (60%). On days 3 and 14, patients in Levamisole group had significantly better cough status distribution when compared to the placebo group (P-value = 0.034 and 0.005, respectively). Moreover, there was significant differences between the two groups in dyspnea at follow-up intervals of 7 (P-value = 0.015) and 14 (P-value = 0.010) days after receiving the interventions. However, no significant difference in fever status was observed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 in both groups (P-value > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that Levamisole may improve most of clinical status of patients with COVID-19. The patients receiving Levamisole had significantly better chance of clinical status including cough and dyspnea on day 14 when compared to the placebo. However, the effect-size of this finding has uncertain clinical importance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered as IRCT20190810044500N7 (19/09/2020).

Title: 
 IL-6 Levels Influence 3-Month All-Cause Mortality in Frail Hospitalized Older Patients 
Abstract: 
The multidimensional prognostic index (MPI) is a sensitive and specific prognosis estimation tool that accurately predicts all-cause mortality in frail older patients. It has been validated to assess the risk of 1-month to 2-year mortality in frail older patients during hospitalization and after hospital discharge. However, whether the MPI is a valid prognostic tool for follow-up periods of different lengths remains to be validated. To this end, we followed up 80 hospitalized patients (female=37, male 43) at least 75 years of age (mean age=82.6±4.4, range=75-94 years) to assess the 3-month all-cause mortality (mean follow-up=61.0 ± 31.7 months [range 4-90 days]). Accordingly, patients were subdivided into low (MPI-1, score 0-0.33), moderate (MPI-2, score 0.34-0.66) and high (MPI-3, score 0.67-1) mortality risk classes. Moreover, baseline biochemical, inflammatory and metabolic parameters, as well as anamnestic and clinical characteristics, were obtained. Although the MPI-3 score was significantly associated with 3-month all-cause mortality in univariate analysis (HR=5.79, 95%CI=1.77-18.92, p=0.004), a multivariate model indicated that only low albumin (HR=0.33, 95%CI=0.16-0.68, p=0.003) and high IL6 (HR=1.01, 95%CI=1.00-1.02, p=0.010) levels were significantly associated with 3-month all-cause mortality. In conclusion, we suggest that measurement of IL6 as well as albumin, rather than the MPI score, may help in providing tailored therapeutic interventions to decrease short term mortality in older hospitalized individuals.
