Title: 
 A data analytics approach for COVID-19 spread and end prediction (with a case study in Iran) 
Abstract: 
World is now experiencing the new pandemic caused by COVID-19 virus and all countries are affected by this disease specially Iran. From the beginning of the outbreak until April 30, 2020, over 90,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Iran. Due to socio-economic problems of this disease, it is required to predict the trend of the outbreak and propose a beneficial method to find out the correct trend. In this paper, we compiled a dataset including the number of confirmed cases, the daily number of death cases and the number of recovered cases. Furthermore, by combining case number variables like behavior and policies that are changing over time and machine-learning (ML) algorithms such as logistic function using inflection point, we created new rates such as weekly death rate, life rate and new approaches to mortality rate and recovery rate. Gaussian functions show superior performance which is helpful for government to improve its awareness about important factors that have significant impacts on future trends of this virus.

Title: 
 Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal in a home with COVID-19 positive occupants 
Abstract: 
Although many COVID-19 patients isolate and recover at home, the dispersal of SARS-CoV-2 onto surfaces and dust within the home environment remains poorly understood To investigate the distribution and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in a home with COVID-19 positive occupants, samples were collected from a household with two confirmed COVID-19 cases (one adult and one child) Home surface swab and dust samples were collected two months after symptom onset (and one month after symptom resolution) in the household The strength of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular signal in fomites varied as a function of sample location, surface material and cleaning practices Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal was detected at several locations throughout the household although cleaning appears to have attenuated the signal on many surfaces Of the 24 surfaces sampled, 46% were SARS-CoV-2 positive at the time of sampling The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in dust recovered from floor and HVAC filter samples ranged from 104 to 105 N2 gene copies/g dust While detection of viral RNA does not imply infectivity, this study confirms that the SARS-CoV-2 RNA signal can be detected at several locations within a COVID-19 isolation home and can persist after symptoms have resolved In addition, the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 (normalized per unit mass of dust) recovered in home HVAC filters may prove useful for estimating SARS-CoV-2 airborne levels in homes In this work, using the quantitative filter forensics methodology, we estimated an average integrated airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration of 69 ± 43 copies/m3 This approach can be used to help building scientists and engineers develop best practices in homes with COVID-19 positive occupants © 2021 The Authors

Title: 
 Retrospective study on the effectiveness of a prevention strategy in a dental hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of a prevention strategy against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among dental hospital staff over a 3-month period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effectiveness of the prevention strategy, which adopted healthcare staff protective measures, including patient triage and correct usage of personal preventive equipment, was evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing. Patients who visited the Affiliated Stomatology Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China, between January 31 and March 1 (lockdown period) and March 2 and April 27 (reopening period) in 2020 and in the same period in 2019 were included in the study. Patients’ diagnosis, age, gender, and several undergoing aerosol-generating procedures during the study period were collected from the hospital’s database. Corresponding data were compared year-on-year (2020-on-2019). A total of 757 hospital staff underwent SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing on April 28–29, 2020. RESULTS: During the lockdown and reopening period in 2020, the number of hospital visits was dramatically decreased to about 6% and 58%, respectively, compared with the same period in 2019. However, emergency visits were increased 16- and 6.4-fold. A total of at least 6654 patients (13.58%) underwent aerosol-generating procedures during the study period in the year 2020. All hospital staff were negative according to SARS-CoV-2 detection and serological testing (IgG, IgM) data. CONCLUSION: During the study period in 2020, the total number of hospital visits dramatically reduced but emergency visits significantly increased. The prevention strategy implemented successfully prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection spread among healthcare workers in a dental hospital. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The prevention strategy indicated patient triage and how to adopt preventive measures for controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread among healthcare workers. These data can be used as a reference for other sectors suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Title: 
 A Rapid Systematic Review of Public Responses to Health Messages Encouraging Vaccination against Infectious Diseases in a Pandemic or Epidemic 
Abstract: 
Public health teams need to understand how the public responds to vaccination messages in a pandemic or epidemic to inform successful campaigns encouraging the uptake of new vaccines as they become available. A rapid systematic review was performed by searching PsycINFO, MEDLINE, healthevidence.org, OSF Preprints and PsyArXiv Preprints in May 2020 for studies including at least one health message promoting vaccine uptake of airborne-, droplet- and fomite-spread viruses. Included studies were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) or the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), and for patient and public involvement (PPI) in the research. Thirty-five articles were included. Most reported messages for seasonal influenza (n = 11; 31%) or H1N1 (n = 11; 31%). Evidence from moderate to high quality studies for improving vaccine uptake included providing information about virus risks and vaccination safety, as well as addressing vaccine misunderstandings, offering vaccination reminders, including vaccination clinic details, and delivering mixed media campaigns across hospitals or communities. Behavioural influences (beliefs and intentions) were improved when: shorter, risk-reducing or relative risk framing messages were used; the benefits of vaccination to society were emphasised; and beliefs about capability and concerns among target populations (e.g., vaccine safety) were addressed. Clear, credible, messages in a language target groups can understand were associated with higher acceptability. Two studies (6%) described PPI in the research process. Future campaigns should consider the beliefs and information needs of target populations in their design, including ensuring that vaccine eligibility and availability is clear, and messages are accessible. More high quality research is needed to demonstrate the effects of messaging interventions on actual vaccine uptake.
