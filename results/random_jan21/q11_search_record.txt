 Embryonic Origins of Virus-Induced Hearing Loss: Overview of Molecular Etiology 
Abstract: 
Hearing loss, one of the most prevalent chronic health conditions, affects around half a billion people worldwide, including 34 million children. The World Health Organization estimates that the prevalence of disabling hearing loss will increase to over 900 million people by 2050. Many cases of congenital hearing loss are triggered by viral infections during different stages of pregnancy. However, the molecular mechanisms by which viruses induce hearing loss are not sufficiently explored, especially cases that are of embryonic origins. The present review first describes the cellular and molecular characteristics of the auditory system development at early stages of embryogenesis. These developmental hallmarks, which initiate upon axial specification of the otic placode as the primary root of the inner ear morphogenesis, involve the stage-specific regulation of several molecules and pathways, such as retinoic acid signaling, Sonic hedgehog, and Wnt. Different RNA and DNA viruses contributing to congenital and acquired hearing loss are then discussed in terms of their potential effects on the expression of molecules that control the formation of the auditory and vestibular compartments following otic vesicle differentiation. Among these viruses, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus appear to have the most effect upon initial molecular determinants of inner ear development. Moreover, of the molecules governing the inner ear development at initial stages, SOX2, FGFR3, and CDKN1B are more affected by viruses causing either congenital or acquired hearing loss. Abnormalities in the function or expression of these molecules influence processes like cochlear development and production of inner ear hair and supporting cells. Nevertheless, because most of such virus–host interactions were studied in unrelated tissues, further validations are needed to confirm whether these viruses can mediate the same effects in physiologically relevant models simulating otic vesicle specification and growth.

 Drug development of an affinity enhanced, broadly neutralizing heavy chain-only antibody that restricts SARS-CoV-2 in rodents 
Abstract: 
We have identified camelid single-domain antibodies (VHHs) that cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-1 and −2, such as VHH72, which binds to a unique highly conserved epitope in the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is difficult to access for human antibodies. Here, we establish a protein engineering path for how a stable, long-acting drug candidate can be generated out of such a VHH building block. When fused to human IgG1-Fc, the prototype VHH72 molecule prophylactically protects hamsters from SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we demonstrate that both systemic and intranasal application protects hACE-2-transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2 induced lethal disease progression. To boost potency of the lead, we used structure-guided molecular modeling combined with rapid yeast-based Fc-fusion prototyping, resulting in the affinity-matured VHH72_S56A-Fc, with subnanomolar SARS-CoV-1 and −2 neutralizing potency. Upon humanization, VHH72_S56A was fused to a human IgG1 Fc with optimized manufacturing homogeneity and silenced effector functions for enhanced safety, and its stability as well as lack of off-target binding was extensively characterized. Therapeutic systemic administration of a low dose of VHH72_S56A-Fc antibodies strongly restricted replication of both original and D614G mutant variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hamsters, and minimized the development of lung damage. This work led to the selection of XVR011 for clinical development, a highly stable anti-COVID-19 biologic with excellent manufacturability. Additionally, we show that XVR011 is unaffected in its neutralizing capacity of currently rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants, and demonstrate its unique, wide scope of binding across the Sarbecovirus clades.

 Metabolomic analyses of COVID-19 patients unravel stage-dependent and prognostic biomarkers 
Abstract: 
The circulating metabolome provides a snapshot of the physiological state of the organism responding to pathogenic challenges. Here we report alterations in the plasma metabolome reflecting the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients with mild (ambulatory) diseases, moderate disease (radiologically confirmed pneumonitis, hospitalization and oxygen therapy), and critical disease (in intensive care). This analysis revealed major disease- and stage-associated shifts in the metabolome, meaning that at least 77 metabolites including amino acids, lipids, polyamines and sugars, as well as their derivatives, were altered in critical COVID-19 patient’s plasma as compared to mild COVID-19 patients. Among a uniformly moderate cohort of patients who received tocilizumab, only 10 metabolites were different among individuals with a favorable evolution as compared to those who required transfer into the intensive care unit. The elevation of one single metabolite, anthranilic acid, had a poor prognostic value, correlating with the maintenance of high interleukin-10 and -18 levels. Given that products of the kynurenine pathway including anthranilic acid have immunosuppressive properties, we speculate on the therapeutic utility to inhibit the rate-limiting enzymes of this pathway including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase.

 Disinfection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from N95 respirators with ozone: a pilot study 
Abstract: 
INTRODUCTION: Personal protective equipment shortages require the reuse of N95 respirators. We sought the necessary conditions for ozone to disinfect N95 respirators for reuse and the effects of multiple cycles of exposure. METHODS: Portions of 3M 1870 N95 respirators were exposed to ozone at 400 ppm with 80% humidity for 2 hours to determine effectiveness of ozone on killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Entire 3M 1870 N95 respirators were exposed to five cycles of 400 ppm with 80% or higher humidity for 2 hours then evaluated for ozone's effects on airflow resistance, filtration efficiency, strap strength and quantitative fit. RESULTS: Ozone exposure disinfected 3M 1870 N95 respirators heavily inoculated with P. aeruginosa. Ozone exposure did not negatively affect the airflow resistance, filtration efficiency, strap strength or fit of the 3M 1870 N95 respirator. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that ozone is a feasible strategy to disinfect N95 respirators for reuse during this and future pandemics.
