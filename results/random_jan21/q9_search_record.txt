 Telegenetics for inherited retinal diseases in the COVID-19 environment 
Abstract: 
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are visually debilitating conditions that affect families worldwide They require extensive clinical testing, examination, and patient and family counseling, which are frequently accomplished over single-day extended clinic visits However, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited the number of patients and staff allowed in clinics, leading to interruptions in care We therefore developed telehealth management protocols for complete or hybrid virtual visits The three main components of our telegenetics approach included reviewing the diagnostic tests results remotely, in-person or virtual video visits with a retina specialist, and virtual genetic testing using saliva kits During the first 5 months of the program, telegenetic care was provided for 80 patients, including 3 international patients, and a spectrum of retinal dystrophies were diagnosed and managed In conclusion, telegenetic virtual visits ensure continuity of care while reducing patient and provider exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and may continue and expand into other medical genetic conditions long after the pandemic

Title: 
 A review on the effect of COVID-19 in type 2 asthma and its management 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is considered the most critical health pandemic of 21st century. Due to extremely high transmission rate, people are more susceptible to viral infection. COVID-19 patients having chronic type-2 asthma prevails a major risk as it may aggravate the disease and morbidities. OBJECTIVE: The present review mainly focuses on correlating the influence of COVID-19 in type-2 asthmatic patients. Besides, it delineates the treatment measures and drugs that can be used to manage mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 in asthmatic patients, thus preventing any exacerbation. METHODS: An in-depth research was carried out from different peer-reviewed articles till September 2020 from several renowned databases like PubMed, Frontier, MEDLINE, and related websites like WHO, CDC, MOHFW, and the information was analysed and written in a simplified manner. RESULTS: The progressive results were quite conflicting as severe cases of COVID-19 shows an increase in the level of several cytokines that can augment inflammation to the bronchial tracts, worsening the asthma attacks. Contradicting to this, certain findings reveal the decrease in the severity of COVID-19 due to the elevation of T-cells in type-2 asthmatic patients, as prominent reduction of T-cell is seen in most of the COVID-19 positive patients. This helps to counteract the balance of immune responses and hence ameliorate the disease progression. CONCLUSION: Asthmatic patients must remain cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic by maintaining all the precautions to stay safe due to limited research data. Future strategies should include a better understanding of asthmatic exacerbation and its relation to COVID-19.

 Case Report: Efficacy of Pyrotinib in ERBB2 Amplification Pulmonary Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma 
Abstract: 
Primary pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinomas are salivary tumors that are low-grade malignant and prone to recurrence and metastasis. Surgery is currently the main treatment, but there is no standard with regard to postoperative adjuvant therapy. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is more sensitive to radiotherapy and patients benefit less from chemotherapy, but few studies have focused on targeted therapy, and their conclusions are inconsistent. With respect to primary pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinoma, large-scale studies cannot be conducted due to its low incidence, and studies on the targeted therapy of it are very scarce. A few case reports indicate that targeted therapy can be effective however, suggesting that it may be a good option. The current report is the first on the occurrence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 amplification in pulmonary adenoid cystic carcinoma. The patient was treated with pyrotinib for 6 months and achieved stable disease.

 Psychometric Properties of the Healthy Lifestyle Questionnaire for Ecuadorian University Students (EVS-EUE) 
Abstract: 
University students are considered a key population in promoting and establishing healthy lifestyles that will ensure a full life for the next generations. The purpose of this study was to do a cultural and linguistic adaptation of the healthy lifestyle questionnaire for Ecuadorian university students (EVS-EUE). Two thousand, one hundred and eight (2108) students from 17 to 19 years old (27%), 20 to 24 years old (57%), and over 24 years old (16%) participated (M = 21.81 years; SD = 3.04). A confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency analysis, and concurrent validity were conducted. The results of the EVS-EUE Questionnaire presented adequate values (Ï‡(2)/d.f = 9.02, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.96, Incremental Fit Index (IFI) = 0.96, McDonald Fit Index (MFI) = 0.91, Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) = 0.94, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.06, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.03). The internal consistency showed values above 0.70, and analyzed its concurrent validity, reaching adequate values. This study has provided a valid and reliable questionnaire to evaluate healthy lifestyles in the Ecuadorian population.

Title: 
 Indications for cement augmentation in fixation of geriatric intertrochanteric femur fractures: a systematic review of evidence. 
Abstract: 
INTRODUCTION Achieving durable mechanical stability in geriatric intertrochanteric proximal femur fractures remains a challenge. Concomitant poor bone quality, unstable fracture patterns, and suboptimal reduction are additional risk factors for early mechanical failure. Cement augmentation of the proximal locking screw or blade is one proposed method to augment implant anchorage. The purpose of this review is to describe the biomechanical and clinical evidence for cement augmentation of geriatric intertrochanteric fractures, and to elaborate indications for cement augmentation. METHODS The PubMed database was searched for English language studies up to January 2021. Studies that assessed effect of calcium phosphate or methylmethacrylate cement augmentation during open reduction and internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures were included. Studies with sample size < 5, nontraumatic or periprosthetic fractures, and nonunion or revision surgery were excluded. Study selection adhered to PRISMA criteria. RESULTS 801 studies were identified, of which 40 met study criteria. 9 studies assessed effect of cement augmentation on fracture displacement. All but one found that cement decreased fracture displacement. 10 studies assessed effect of cement augmentation on total load or cycles to failure. All but one demonstrated that augmented implants increased this variable. Complication rates of cement augmentation during ORIF of intertrochanteric fractures ranged from 0 to 47%, while non-augmented implants ranged from 0 to 51%. Reoperation rates ranged from 0 to 11% in the cement-augmented group and 0 to 11% in the non-augmented group. Fixation failure ranged from 0 to 11% in the cement-augmented group and 0 to 20% in the non-augmented group. Nonunion ranged from 0 to 3.6% in the cement-augmented group and 0 to 34% in the non-augmented group. CONCLUSIONS Calcium phosphate or PMMA-augmented CMN fixation of IT fractures increased construct stability and improved outcomes in biomechanical and early clinical studies. The findings of these studies suggest an important role for cement augmentation in patient populations at high risk of mechanical failure.
