 Nutrition-Based Approaches in Clinical Trials Targeting Cognitive Function: Highlights of the CTAD 2020 
Abstract: 
The Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) 2020 conference was the stage for researchers from all over the world to present their recent and ongoing research focused on potential Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments and prevention of cognitive decline. Among a varied range of topics, nutritional aspects arose as possibilities of treatments towards the promotion of a healthy aging. Among the discussed themes, supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and multi-nutrient approaches were presented, suggesting that long-term supplementation (i.e., over 3 years) might be needed for observing positive effects on cognitive performance. Trials testing ketogenic agents and carbohydrate-restricted diet were also presented and showed promising effects on improving cognitive function of mild-cognitive impaired (MCI) and pre-diabetic individuals, respectively, in a short-term way (i.e. after 3 to 6 months). The combination of some of the nutritional approaches with physical activity interventions raises the question on whether they would individually perform in a similar way. Promising therapies involving nutrition appear to be safe and well tolerated by volunteers. Failures on achieving positive findings raise questions on whether they were driven by specific characteristics of the studied populations, insufficient doses or duration of treatment. Notwithstanding, current evidence on the applicability of nutrition-based approaches as AD treatments are encouraging but demand further research on the topic.

 Association between universal face shield in a quaternary care center and reduction of SARS-COV2 infections among healthcare personnel and hospitalized patients 
Abstract: 
We implemented universal face shield use for all healthcare personnel upon entry to facility in order to counter an increase in SARS-COV2 cases among healthcare personnel and hospitalized patients. There was a marked reduction of infections in both healthcare personnel and hospitalized patients between pre and post intervention. Our results support universal face shield use as part of a multifaceted approach in areas of high SARS-COV2 community transmission.

 Pinpointing the potential hits for hindering interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein with ACE2 from the pool of antiviral phytochemicals utilizing molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations 
Abstract: 
SARS-CoV-2, the viral particle, is responsible for triggering the 2019 Coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19). To tackle this situation, a number of strategies are being devised to either create an antidote, a vaccine, or agents capable of preventing its infection. To enable research on these strategies, numerous target proteins are identified where Spike (S) protein is presumed to be of immense potential. S-protein interacts with human angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2) for cell entry. The key region of S-protein that interacts with ACE2 is a portion of it designated as a receptor-binding domain (RBD), following whereby the viral membrane fuses with the alveolar membrane to enter the human cell. The proposition is to recognize molecules from the bundle of phytochemicals of medicinal plants known to possess antiviral potentials as a lead that could interact and mask RBD, rendering them unavailable to form ACE2 interactions. Such a molecule is called the 'S-protein blocker'. A total of 110 phytochemicals from Withania somnifera, Asparagus racemosus, Zinziber officinalis, Allium sativum, Curcuma longa and Adhatoda vasica were used in the study, of which Racemoside A, Ashwagandhanolide, Withanoside VI, Withanoside IV and Racemoside C were identified as top five hits using molecular docking. Further, essential Pharmacophore features and their ADMET profiles of these compounds were studied following to which the best three hits were analyzed for their interaction with RBD using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation. Binding free energy calculations were performed using MM/GBSA, proving these phytochemicals can serve as S-protein blocker.
