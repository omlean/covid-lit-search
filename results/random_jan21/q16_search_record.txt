Title: 
 Microbial Contamination Risk and Disinfection of Radiation Protective Garments. 
Abstract: 
ABSTRACT Healthcare-associated infections are a major public health concern for both patients and medical personnel. This has taken on greater urgency during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Radiation Personal Protective Equipment (RPPE) may contribute to risks of microbial contamination. This possibility was tested in 61 personal or shared-use lead aprons and thyroid collars at Columbia Presbyterian Irving Medical Center. Fifty percent tested positive for either bacterial or fungal contamination, mostly around the neckline of lead vests and thyroid collars. Repeated testing of garments some weeks to months later confirmed continued presence of microbial contamination. The possibility that hospital-approved disinfection agents could degrade the radio-protective features of these garments was also examined. Samples of identical construction to garments in regular use were subjected to either daily or weekly wipes with hypochlorite or alcohol-based hospital-approved cleaning agents for 6 mo. A third group of samples was maintained in contact with the cleaning agents for 6 mo. All samples were fluoroscoped four times during the study. None demonstrated any degradation in radioprotection. All samples were photographed monthly. Physical degradation of the outer plastic covering by concentrated hypochlorite and limited mechanical damage around stitched seams of the samples cleaned daily with alcohol was noted. Based on the high prevalence of microbial contamination, regular cleaning and disinfection protocols should be implemented. Regular cleaning with medical-facility-approved cleaning and disinfecting agents is likely to be effective at reducing the microbial load and unlikely to result in significant reduction in radioprotective properties of these garments.

 Transcriptomics-based drug repositioning pipeline identifies therapeutic candidates for COVID-19 
Abstract: 
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and has few effective treatments. We applied a computational drug repositioning pipeline to SARS-CoV-2 differential gene expression signatures derived from publicly available data. We utilized three independent published studies to acquire or generate lists of differentially expressed genes between control and SARS-CoV-2-infected samples. Using a rank-based pattern matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic, the signatures were queried against drug profiles from Connectivity Map (CMap). We validated sixteen of our top predicted hits in live SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assays in either Calu-3 or 293T-ACE2 cells. Validation experiments in human cell lines showed that 11 of the 16 compounds tested to date (including clofazimine, haloperidol and others) had measurable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. These initial results are encouraging as we continue to work towards a further analysis of these predicted drugs as potential therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19.

 Race and ethnicity in pandemic times 
Abstract: 
Social scientists working on race and ethnicity are facing up to the challenge of how the Covid-19 pandemic is impacting on their research agendas In this introduction, we discuss the emerging evidence about the impact of Covid-19 in terms of race and ethnicity, on migrants and refugees, and on research agendas By focusing on the discussion that has developed about these issues during 2020 we aim to provide some of the broader background to the specific concerns to be found in the rest of this themed issue We move on from this overview of key developments to a discussion of the key themes that are explored by the fourteen papers that follow

Title: 
 What is in the Final Stage of Inter-Language? Tone Errors and Phonological Constraints in Spontaneous Speech in Very Advanced Learners of Mandarin 
Abstract: 
Following the research direction proposed in Zhang (Journal of Chinese Language Teachers Association 45(1):39–65, 2010, The second language acquisition of Mandarin Chinese tones by English, Japanese and Korean speakers. [Doctoral Dissertation], University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, 2013, Second language acquisition of Mandarin Chinese tones—Beyond first language transfer, Brill, 2018), this study examines the tone errors and substitution patterns in spontaneous connected speech produced by L2 learners who have progressed further into advanced or superior levels of proficiency. Based on the distinct patterns of errors and substitution patterns in their speech samples, effects of phonological universals in the format of constraints, including tone markedness scales (TMS), tone-position constraints (TPC) and the obligatory contour principle (OCP), are studied. Comparisons are made between the findings about tonal acquisition made in previous studies on lower-level learners and the higher-level learners in this study. With these error data, analyses and comparisons, I argue that some effects of the above-mentioned universals are still visible (TMS and T4-T4 OCP) while others are masked. It is a special configuration of the coarticulation rule applying to T2-T4 and T2-T1 combinations that really distinguishes the tonal system found in these very advanced learners from that of the other learners and that of the native speakers of Mandarin. Pedagogical practices that are designed to re-configure this rule will allow learners at this stage of tone acquisition to proceed into native-like speech production.

Title: 
 Acute limb ischemia in a patient with Covid-19 pneumonia: a case report 
Abstract: 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic across the world. Hypercoagulability status in COVID-19 is one of the causes of complication from severe COVID-19 with a high risk of arterial thrombosis. Acute Limb Ischemia is a vascular emergency caused by sudden decrease in the arterial perfusion. We report the case of a 53-year-old male patient with COVID-19 Pneumonia, diagnosed with Acute Limb Ischemia. From clinical examination, which included anamnesis, physical examination, and laboratory results as well as chest X-rays, a suspicion of Acute Limb Ischemia was found in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. The SARS-CoV-2 real time PCR examination showed positive results. In this patient, the diagnosis of Acute Limb Ischemia with Covid-19 Pneumonia was established through a multidisciplinary approach covering the fields of pulmonology, cardiology, and thoracic and cardiovascular surgery.
