Title: 
 Efficacy of a Low-Dose Diosmin Therapy on Improving Symptoms and Quality of Life in Patients with Chronic Venous Disease: Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial 
Abstract: 
Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a common medical condition affecting up to 80% of the general population. Clinical manifestations can range from mild to more severe signs and symptoms that contribute to the impairment of the quality of life (QoL) of affected patients. Among treatment options, venoactive drugs such as diosmin are widely used in the symptomatic treatment in all clinical stages. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new formulated diosmin in relieving symptoms and improving QoL in patients suffering from CVD. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical study, CVD patients with a Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification system between C2 and C4 were randomized to receive a bioavailable diosmin (as μsmin(®) Plus) 450 mg tablet once daily or a placebo for 8 weeks. Clinical symptoms and QoL were monitored using the measurement of leg circumference, visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, Global Index Score (GIS) and Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS). A total of 72 subjects completed the study. From week 4, leg edema was significantly decreased in the active group (p < 0.001). An improvement in the VAS score was observed in the active group compared to placebo at the end of treatment (p < 0.05). GIS and VCSS scores were significantly improved in the active group at week 8 (p < 0.001). No treatment related-side effects were recorded. The results of this study showed that the administration of low-dose μsmin(®) Plus was safe and effective in relieving symptoms and improving QoL in subjects with CVD.

Title: 
 Promoting social distancing and preventing panic buying during the epidemic of COVID-19: the contributions of people's psychological and behavioural factors 
Abstract: 
Objectives: COVID-19 disease has progressed to the level of a global pandemic. This study aimed to investigate people's psychological and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 epidemic and explore the predictors for social distancing and panic buying. Methods: A 17-item questionnaire was developed and distributed randomly to people using social media. Descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA were used to assess people's psychological and behavioural responses. Hierarchical regression was conducted to investigate the predictive effects of psychological and behavioural variables on reports of social distancing and panic buying respectively. Results: Respondents reported a low degree of risk perception and risk beliefs with regard to being outside, and had moderate psychological stress and positive safeguarding behaviours for being outside. Respondents reported high concern regarding COVID-19 and tended to keep social distancing during the epidemic. They would panic-purchase food and supplies. In addition, psychological stress emerged as a very strong predictor for reporting COVID-19 concerns and panic buying. Furthermore, reported concerns about COVID-19 information sharing had a significant predictive influence on panic buying of food. Safeguarding behaviours for being outside had a significant predictive effect on respondents reported social distancing of cancelling outings. Reported concerns about COVID-19 were stronger predictors for reported social distancing. Conclusion: It is important to relieve people's psychological stress and manage information sharing to control panic buying. In addition, we should promote adoption of safeguarding behaviours for being outside and emphasise the concerns with regard to COVID-19 to encourage people keep social distancing. Measures should be implemented according to the characteristics of the population.

Title: 
 Heterogeneity in COVID-19 patient volume, characteristics and outcomes across US Department of Veterans Affairs facilities: an observational cohort study 
Abstract: 
ObjectiveStudies describe COVID-19 patient characteristics and outcomes across populations, but reports of variation across healthcare facilities are lacking The objectives were to examine differences in COVID-19 patient volume and mortality across facilities, and understand whether facility variation in mortality was due primarily to differences in patient versus facility characteristics DesignObservational cohort study with multilevel mixed effects logistic regression modelling SettingThe Veterans Health Administration (VA) is the largest healthcare system in the USA ParticipantsPatients with COVID-19 Main outcomeAll-cause mortality within 45 days after COVID-19 testing (March–May, follow-up through 16 July 2020) ResultsAmong 13 510 patients with COVID-19, 3942 (29 2%) were admitted (2266/3942 (57 5%) ward;1676/3942 (42 5%) intensive care unit (ICU)) and 679/3942 (17 2%) received mechanical ventilation Marked heterogeneity was observed across facilities in median age (range: 34 3–83 9 years;facility mean: 64 7, SD 7 2 years);patient volume (range: 1–737 at 160 facilities;facility median: 48 5, IQR 14–105 5);hospital admissions (range: 1–286 at 133 facilities;facility median: 11, IQR 1–26 5);ICU caseload (range: 1–85 at 115 facilities;facility median: 4, IQR 0–12);and mechanical ventilation (range: 1–53 at 90 facilities;facility median: 1, IQR 0–5) Heterogeneity was also observed in facility mortality for all patients with COVID-19 (range: 0%–29 7%;facility median: 8 9%, IQR 2 4%–13 7%);inpatients (range: 0%–100%;facility median: 18 0%, IQR 5 6%–28 6%);ICU patients (range: 0%–100%;facility median: 28 6%, IQR 14 3%–50 0%);and mechanical ventilator patients (range: 0%–100%;facility median: 52 7%, IQR 33 3%–80 6%) The majority of variation in facility mortality was attributable to differences in patient characteristics (eg, age) ConclusionsMarked heterogeneity in COVID-19 patient volume, characteristics and mortality were observed across VA facilities nationwide Differences in patient characteristics accounted for the majority of explained variation in mortality across sites Variation in unadjusted COVID-19 mortality across facilities or nations should be considered with caution

Title: 
 Predictors of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Socio-demographics, Co-Morbidity and Past Racial Discrimination 
Abstract: 
Importance: Immunization programs are only successful when there are high rates of acceptance and coverage. While delivering billions of COVID 19 doses globally addressing vaccine hesitancy will be one of the most significant public health communication efforts ever undertaken. Objective: The goal of this study is to explore predictors of COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy, including sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, risk perception, and experience of discrimination, in a sample of the U.S. population. Design: We used a cross sectional online survey study design. The survey was implemented between Dec 13 and 23, 2020. Setting: The survey was limited to respondents over 18 years of age residing in the USA. Participants: Respondents were individuals belonging to priority groups for vaccine distribution. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Respondents were asked how likely they would be to take a COVID 19 vaccine if offered at no cost within two months. Vaccine hesitancy was measured using a scale ranging from 1 (low hesitancy) to 6 (high hesitancy). Results: Responses were received from 2,650 respondents (response rate 84%) from all 50 states and Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam. The majority were in the age category between 25 and 44 years (66%), male (53%), and working in the healthcare sector (61%). Most were White and non-Hispanic (66%) respondents followed by Black non-Hispanic (14%) and Hispanic (8%) respondents. Experience with racial discrimination was a predictor of vaccine hesitancy. Those reporting racial discrimination having 21% increased odds of being at a higher level of hesitancy compared to those who did not report such experience (OR=1.21, 95% C.I. 1.01-1.45). Conclusions and Relevance: Communication and logistical aspects during the COVID 19 vaccination campaign need to be sensitive to individuals past-experience of discrimination by identifying appropriate channels of communication and sites for vaccine distribution to reach those who may have sentiments of mistrust in the vaccination campaign.
