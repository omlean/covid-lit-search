Abstract: 
Background: COVID-19 outbreak brought many challenges to the society and to health care systems Health care professionals in dental practices are a high-risk population, due to close contact to saliva and aerosols Specific guidance for those professionals is essential to control disease transmission and guarantee dentist's health Material and Methods: We performed a literature review based on online search in Pubmed, Scientific Electronic Library, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude and Scopus databases Included articles were fully read and analysed regarding infection control measurements, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), conditions for procedures and use of mouthrinse Results: Nineteen articles were added to this review The majority of them recommended maintaining only urgency treatments, with use of rubber dam and mouthrinse before procedures Conclusions: The data collected suggests dental care should be performed under strict protection measures such as a pre-check questionnaire prior to any dental procedure;postponing elective dental treatments and following infection control security procedures may be strategic at this point The use of adequate PPE for procedures is recommended Supplementary measures should rise from further understanding of the pandemics Key words: COVID-19, dentistry, practice

Title: 
 Frequency of depressive symptoms in Syrian refugees and Turkish maintenance hemodialysis patients during COVID-19 pandemic 
Abstract: 
INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia of unknown cause was detected on 30 December 2019 in China. It was categorized as an outbreak and named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. The pandemic affects all people, but patient groups such as hemodialysis (HD) patients have been particularly affected. We do not know if refugees suffered more during the outbreak. In this study, we compared depressive symptom frequency between Syrian refugee HD patients and Turkish ones. METHODS: The study had a single-center, cross-sectional design. Demographic and clinical data were collected retrospectively from patients' files containing details about past medical history, demographic variables and laboratory values. Validated Turkish and Arabic forms of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to assess depressive symptoms. BDI scores were compared according to nationality, demographic features and clinical data. A BDI score more than 14 was accepted as suspicion of depression. RESULTS: 119 patients were enrolled in the study. After the exclusion of 22 patients, 75 Turkish and 22 Syrian patients were included for further analysis. The median BDI (interquartile range) score for Turkish and Syrian patients were 12 (7-23) and 19.5 (12.7-25.2), respectively (p = 0.03). Suspicion of depression was present at 42.7% of Turkish, and 72.7% of Syrian HD patients (p = 0.013). Regarding all patients, phosphorus level, Kt/V, and nationality were significantly different between patients with and without suspicion of depression (p = 0.023, 0.039, 0.013, respectively). CONCLUSION: Syrian patients had higher BDI scores and more depressive symptoms than Turkish patients. Additional national measures for better integration and more mental support to Syrian HD patients are needed.

Title: 
 Applications of the High Impact Practices in Family Planning during COVID-19 
Abstract: 
The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially strained health systems across the globe. In particular, documented disruptions to voluntary family planning and reproductive health care due to competing health priorities, service disruptions, stockouts, and lockdowns are significantly impacting reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health. As governments and family planning programmes grapple with how best to respond to the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic on family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), the implementation and adaptation of evidence-based practices is crucial. In this commentary, we outline applications of the High Impact Practices in Family Planning (HIPs) towards COVID-19 response efforts. The HIPs are a set of evidence-based family planning practices which reflect global expert consensus on what works in family planning programming. Drawing upon preliminary COVID-19 data, documented experiences from prior health emergencies, and recommended programme adaptations from a variety of global health partners, we outline situations where specific HIPs may assist family planning programme managers in developing context-specific and evidence-based responses to COVID-19-related impacts on FP/RH, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the accessibility, availability, and continuity of voluntary family planning services across the world.
