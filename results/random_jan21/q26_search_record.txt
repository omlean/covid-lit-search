Title: 
 A New Conceptual ‘Cylinder’ Framework for Sustainable Bioeconomy Systems and Their Actors 
Abstract: 
Concepts for sustainable bioeconomy systems are gradually replacing the ones on linear product chains. The reason is that continuously expanding linear chain activities are considered to contribute to climate change, reduced biodiversity, over-exploitation of resources, food insecurity, and the double burden of disease. Are sustainable bioeconomy systems a guarantee for a healthy planet? If yes, why, when, and how? In literature, different sustainability indicators have been presented to shed light on this complicated question. Due to high degrees of complexity and interactions of actors in bioeconomy systems, trade-offs and non-linear outcomes became apparent. This fueled the debates about the normative dimensions of the bioeconomy. In particular, the behavior of actors and the utilization of products do not seem to be harmonized according to the environmental, social, and economic pillars of sustainability. Potential conflicts require a new conceptual framework that is here introduced. It consists of a ‘sustainability’ cylinder captured between an inner-cylinder, representing order, and an outer-cylinder for chaos, based on the laws of physics and complex adaptive systems. Such a framework permits (bioeconomy) systems to propagate in the sustainability zone only if they follow helical pathways serving as the new norms. Helices are a combination of two sinusoidal patterns. The first represents here the sustainable behavior of interacting actors and the second the balanced usage of resources and products. The latter counteracts current growth discourses. The applicability of the conceptual cylinder framework is positively verified via 9 cases in Europe, which encompass social-organizational and product-technological innovations. –

Title: 
 Frequency of putative enteric zoster diagnosed using saliva samples in patients with abdominal pain: a prospective study. 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infects and establishes latency in neurons in the ganglia of the cranial nerve, dorsal root and enteric ganglia. VZV reactivation in enteric neurons (enteric zoster) can cause non-specific abdominal pain and/or serious gastrointestinal dysfunction without cutaneous manifestations. Detection of VZV DNA in saliva may be useful for identifying enteric zoster. We evaluated the frequency of putative enteric zoster based on the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with acute abdominal pain. METHODS Adult patients who visited the emergency room due to moderate to severe acute abdominal pain were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital between May 2019 and November 2019. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) was performed in all patients. We also evaluated the presence of salivary VZV DNA in patients with confirmed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) who were under stressful conditions. Saliva samples were collected from all studied patients. Enteric zoster was suspected based on the presence of salivary VZV DNA, detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS Fifty patients with moderate to severe abdominal pain were enrolled. Five of 50 patients exhibited positive VZV-DNA PCR results. APCT revealed that among these five patients, two had pancreatic head cancer, two had small bowel obstruction after intra-abdominal surgery, and one had no remarkable findings. However, all 14 patients with COVID-19 showed negative salivary VZV-DNA PCR results. CONCLUSIONS Approximately 10% of patients with moderate to severe acute abdominal pain showed positivity for salivary VZV DNA. Further studies are warranted on whether antiviral therapy based on salivary VZV-DNA PCR results may relieve abdominal pain in the studied patient population.

Title: 
 [SARS-CoV-2 and neurological disorders: the revelance of biomarkers?] 
Abstract: 
Soon after the pandemic, numerous publications described cases of neurological disorders associated with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The range of neurological symptoms is becoming increasingly more extensive as the pandemic progresses. However, it is not yet well established whether the manifestations are due to direct viral damage to the nervous system or indirect consequences of the infection. This review presents an inventory of the biochemical markers studied in the context of neurological disorders related to SARS-CoV-2. By reflecting various physiopathological mechanisms, these biomarkers allow both a better understanding of the pathophysiology of Covid-19 and a contribution to the diagnosis of neurologic troubles; they could participate in the prognostic evaluation of patients.

Title: 
 Antibiotic Prescribing Patterns at COVID-19 Dedicated Wards in Bangladesh: A Single Center Point-Prevalence Survey 
Abstract: 
There is a clear deficiency in antimicrobial usage data and ongoing stewardship programs both in government and private health care facilities in Bangladesh. As evidences are mounting regarding irrational and often unnecessary use of antibiotics during COVID-19 pandemic, a point prevalence survey (PPS) was conducted across COVID-19 dedicated wards in Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). Antibiotic usage data were collected from 193 patients at different COVID-19 dedicated wards at DMCH between 21 May, 2020 and 10 June, 2020. Comparisons in antibiotic usage were made between different groups using Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact test. Factors associated with multiple antibiotic prescription were evaluated using binary logistic regression model. On survey date all (100%) patients were receiving at least one antibiotic with 133 patients (68.91%) receiving multiple antibiotics. Overall, patients presenting with severe disease received more antibiotics on average. Third generation cephalosporin ceftriaxone (53.8%), meropenem (40.9%), moxifloxacin (29.5%) and doxycycline (25.4%) were the four most prescribed antibiotics among survey patients. Among comorbidities diabetes mellitus (DM) was independently associated with increased antibiotic prescribing. Abnormal C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum d-dimer were linked with higher odds of antibiotic prescribing among survey patients. Overall, prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19 patients at DMCH was very high. This could be attributed to a lack of clear treatment protocol against COVID-19 till date as well as lack of modern laboratory facilities to support judicial antibiotic prescribing in Bangladesh. A well-functioning antibiotic stewardship program in Bangladesh is required to prevent an impending health crisis.
