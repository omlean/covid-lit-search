Title: 
 Short-term Effects of Cancelled Elective Procedures due to COVID-19: Evidence from the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether delayed or cancelled elective procedures due to COVID-19 resulted in higher rates of emergency department (ED) utilization and/or increased mortality. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: On March 15, 2020, the Veterans Affairs (VA) issued a nationwide order to temporarily pause elective cases due to COVID-19. The effects of this disruption on patient outcomes are not yet known. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Surgical procedures cancelled due to COVID-19 in 2020 (n = 3,326) were matched to similar completed procedures in 2018 (n = 151,863) and 2019 (n = 146,582). Outcome measures included 30- and 90-day VA ED use and mortality in the period following the completed or cancelled procedure. We used exact matching on surgical procedure category and nearest neighbor matching on patient characteristics, procedure year, and facility. RESULTS: Patients with elective surgical procedures cancelled due to COVID-19 were no more likely to have an ED visit in the 30- (Difference: -4.3% pts; 95% CI: -0.078, -0.007) and 90âdays (-0.9% pts; 95% CI: -0.068, 0.05) following the expected case date. Patients with cancellations had no difference in 30- (Difference: 0.1% pts; 95% CI: -0.008, 0.01) and 90-day (Difference: -0.4% pts; 95% CI: -0.016, 0.009) mortality rates when compared to similar patients with similar procedures that were completed in previous years. CONCLUSIONS: The pause in elective surgical cases was not associated with short-term adverse outcomes in VA hospitals, suggesting appropriate surgical case triage and management. Further study will be essential to determine if the delayed cases were associated with longer-term effects.

Title: 
 Anxiety, depression, trauma-related, and sleep disorders among healthcare workers duirng the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis. 
Abstract: 
Healthcare workers have been facing the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous critical patients and deaths, and high workloads. Quality of care is related to the mental status of healthcare workers. This PRISMA systematic review and meta-analysis, on Pubmed/Psycinfo up to October 8, 2020, estimates the prevalence of mental health problems among healthcare workers during this pandemic. The systematic review included 70 studies (101 017 participants) and only high-quality studies were included in the meta-analysis. The following pooled prevalences were estimated: 30,0 % of anxiety (95%CI, 24.2 - 37.05); 31,1 % of depression (95%CI, 25.7 -36.8); 56,5% of acute stress (95%CI - 30.6 - 80.5); 20,2% of post-traumatic stress (95%CI, 9.9 - 33.0); 44.0 % of sleep disorders (95%CI, 24.6 - 64.5). The following factors were found to be sources of heterogeneity in subgroups and metaregressions analysis: proportion of female, nurses, and location. Targeted prevention and support strategies are needed now, and early in case of future health crises.
