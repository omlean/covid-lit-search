Acute and chronic inflammatory neuropathies and COVID-19 vaccines: Practical recommendations from the task force of the Italian Peripheral Nervous System Association (ASNP)
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To develop recommendations for vaccination for coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) in patients with inflammatory neuropathies. METHODS: Key questions were formulated in order to perform a literature review on the safety and efficacy of vaccines in patients with inflammatory neuropathies. Based on the best evidence and expert opinion, a list of recommendations was formulated to inform decision on vaccination for COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory neuropathies and increase adherence to vaccination programmes. RESULTS: Recommendations addressing safety and efficacy of vaccination in patients with inflammatory neuropathies were formulated. No data are currently available on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with inflammatory neuropathies or other immune-mediated conditions. There is only sparse data on the safety of previous available vaccines in patients with inflammatory neuropathies, but studies on other autoimmune disorders indicate that these are safe and mostly efficacious. Patients with inflammatory neuropathies might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Patients with inflammatory neuropathies should be encouraged to adhere to the vaccination campaign for COVID-19. These recommendations provide guidance on the management of vaccinations for COVID-19 in patients with inflammatory neuropathies. More research is needed regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccination in patients with inflammatory neuropathies and other immune conditions.
