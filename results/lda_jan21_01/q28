The contrasting role of nasopharyngeal angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transcription in SARS-CoV-2 infection: A cross-sectional study of people tested for COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada
Abstract: 
 BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein serves as the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, with a critical role in viral infection. We aim to understand population level variation of nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between ACE2 transcription and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, while adjusting for expression of: (i) the complementary protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), (ii) soluble ACE2, (iii) age, and (iv) biological sex. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of transmembrane and soluble transcripts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of n = 424 "participants" aged 1-104 years referred for COVID-19 testing was performed in British Columbia, Canada. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were matched by age and biological sex to patients who tested negative. Viral load and host gene expression were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: Analysis showed no association between age and nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription in those who tested negative for COVID-19 (P = 0â¢092). Mean relative transcription of transmembrane (P = 0â¢00012) and soluble (P<0â¢0001) ACE2 isoforms, as well as TMPRSS2 (P<0â¢0001) was higher in COVID-19-negative participants than COVID--19 positive ones, yielding a negative correlation between targeted host gene expression and positive COVID-19 diagnosis. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants, transcription of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load (B = 0â¢49, R2=0â¢14, P<0â¢0001), transcription of soluble ACE2 negatively correlated (B= -0â¢85, R2= 0â¢26, P<0â¢0001), and no correlation was found with TMPRSS2 transcription (B= -0â¢042, R2=<0â¢10, P = 0â¢69). Multivariable analysis showed that the greatest viral RNA loads were observed in participants with high transmembrane ACE2 transcription (&#914;= 0â¢89, 95%CI: [0â¢59 to 1â¢18]), while transcription of the soluble isoform appears to protect against high viral RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (&#914;= -0â¢099, 95%CI: [-0â¢18 to -0â¢022]). INTERPRETATION: Nasopharyngeal ACE2 transcription plays a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transcription of the transmembrane ACE2 isoform positively correlates, while transcription of the soluble isoform negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for age, biological sex, and transcription of TMPRSS2. FUNDING: This project (COV-55) was funded by Genome British Columbia as part of their COVID-19 rapid response initiative.

A Negative Feedback Model to Explain Regulation of SARS-CoV-2 Replication and Transcription
Abstract: 
 Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Although a preliminary understanding of the replication and transcription of SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged, their regulation remains unknown Results: By comprehensive analysis of genome sequence and protein structure data, we propose a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of CoV replication and transcription, providing a molecular basis of the "leader-to-body fusion" model The key step leading to the proposal of our model was that the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) motifs were identified as the cleavage sites of nsp15, a nidoviral RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) According to this model, nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs), and genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by cleaving TRSs The expression level of nsp15 controls the relative proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs, which in turn change the expression level of nsp15 to reach equilibrium between the CoV replication and transcription Conclusion: The replication and transcription of CoVs are regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that influences the persistence of CoVs in hosts Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, and provide new clues for future studies One important clue is that nsp15 may be an important and ideal target for the development of drugs (e g , uridine derivatives) against CoVs

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may exploit human transcription factors involved in retinoic acid and interferon-mediated response: a hypothesis supported by an in-silico analysis
Abstract: 
 The SARS-CoV-2 causing acute respiratory disease COVID-19 is considered a worldwide emergency. Since recently it has been found that SARS-coronavirus are dependent on the host transcriptional factors (TF) to express the viral genes, efforts are required to understand the molecular interplay between virus and host response. By bioinformatic analysis, we investigated human TF that can bind the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and can be involved in viral transcription. In particular, we analyzed the key role of the TF involved in interferon response. We found that several TF could be induced by the interferon antiviral response, specifically some induced by IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and by un-phosphorylated ISGF3, that were found to promote the transcription of several viral open reading frame. Moreover, we found 22 TF binding sites that are present only in the sequence of virus infecting humans and not in Bat coronavirus RaTG13. The 22 TF are involved in the IFN, the retinoic acid signaling and the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, thus facilitating its own replication cycle. This mechanism, by competition, may steal the human TF involved in these processes, explaining SARS-CoV-2 disruption of the IFN-I signalling in host cells and the mechanism of the SARS retinoic acid depletion syndrome leading to the cytokine storm. We identified also three TF binding sites present exclusively in the Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant that may explain the higher severity of the respiratory syndrome in this virus variant. These data shed light on SARS-CoV2 dependence from the host transcription machinery associated to interferon response and strengthen our knowledge about the transcription and replicative activity of the virus and could pave the way for new targets drug design and therapeutic approaches.
