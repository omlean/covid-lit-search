Diabetic fibrosis
Abstract: 
 Diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality is predominantly due to complications of the disease that may cause debilitating conditions, such as heart and renal failure, hepatic insufficiency, retinopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Fibrosis, the excessive and inappropriate deposition of extracellular matrix in various tissues, is commonly found in patients with advanced type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and may contribute to organ dysfunction. Hyperglycemia, lipotoxic injury and insulin resistance activate a fibrotic response, not only through direct stimulation of matrix synthesis by fibroblasts, but also by promoting a fibrogenic phenotype in immune and vascular cells, and possibly also by triggering epithelial and endothelial cell conversion to a fibroblast-like phenotype. High glucose stimulates several fibrogenic pathways, triggering reactive oxygen species generation, stimulating neurohumoral responses, activating growth factor cascades (such as TGF-ß/Smad3 and PDGFs), inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, generating advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and stimulating the AGE-RAGE axis, and upregulating fibrogenic matricellular proteins. Although diabetes-activated fibrogenic signaling has common characteristics in various tissues, some organs, such as the heart, kidney and liver develop more pronounced and clinically significant fibrosis. This review manuscript summarizes current knowledge on the cellular and molecular pathways involved in diabetic fibrosis, discussing the fundamental links between metabolic perturbations and fibrogenic activation, the basis for organ-specific differences, and the promises and challenges of anti-fibrotic therapies for diabetic patients.

Investigation of shielding properties of impregnated activated carbon for gamma-rays
Abstract: 
 Carbon related structures are extraordinarily attractive materials for researchers and especially for organic chemistry, besides being the most important basic materials of daily life. The richness of various optical and electronic behaviors has made them one of the rapidly rising materials on the horizon of material science and condensed matter physics. Having the sheets of atoms that are stacked in a disorganized manner makes activated carbon being different from other forms of carbon -graphite- structures. The researches about the shielding properties of activated carbon atoms for gamma-rays are very rare and required to be improved. Since the use of radioactive sources in different fields (nuclear industry, shielding material, radiation biophysics and space research application, etc.) has been increasing expeditiously, the photon interactions with matter has gained more importance in the world of material science technology. In this article, we review the basics of the impregnated activated carbons (AC1 and AC2), as well as the link between the structural behaviors and the gamma shielding properties in terms of both quality and efficiency. Both XCom software and EGSnrc simulation code were used to obtain the theoretical calculations that are significantly important to be able to understand the shielding properties of impregnated activated carbons (AC1 and AC2) for gamma-rays. At the end, the mass attenuation coefficients (µm), the total atomic and the electronic cross-sections (&#963;t,a and &#963;t,e), the effective atomic number and the effective electron density (Zeff and Neff), the half value layer (HVL), the tenth value layer (TVL), and the mean free path (MFP) values of such materials were calculated and then compared with those of some other known shielding materials like lead, borosilicate, concrete and vermiculite. The calculated data showed that impregnated activated carbons (AC1 and AC2) are very appropriate and consistent to be one of the candidates for shielding materials of gamma-rays.
