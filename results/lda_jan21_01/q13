By Way of Conclusion: The Present Crisis and the Religions of the Future
Abstract: 
 For several decades now, provoked by secularism and privatization, religions have been thinking about how they could survive. But the new conditions of our global world, both in the North and the South, rather prompt us to pose the question about the future shape of religions, rather than the future of religion. The urgency of a common endeavor flows from the crisis situation in which humankind finds itself and the future prospects becoming bleak. In this context, it is important for religions to focus their attention on the destiny of humankind and nature, and not enter into self-isolation. This will be the engaging questions for all religions of the future.

Looking beyond pulmonary disease in COVID-19: A lesson from patients with cystic fibrosis
Abstract: 
 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused more than 52.775.271 million confirmed cases, 1.293.106 deaths, globally, and afflicted 208 countries, areas, or territories; and almost three months have passed since the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Despite the dramatic and global impact of the Coronavirus, the knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been improved remarkably. Herein, we provided the rationale for SARS-CoV-2 infection as endothelial dysfunction rather than respiratory disease. Accordingly, we strongly invited the researchers to look beyond pulmonary injury and shift their attention from respiratory disease to endothelial disorder. This strategy could be particularly relevant to identifying therapeutic weapons stabilizing the endothelium rather than the lungs.
