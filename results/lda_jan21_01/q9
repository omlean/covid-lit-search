Technical Note: Self-shielding evaluation and radiation leakage measurement of a jawless ring gantry linac with a beam stopper
Abstract: 
 PURPOSE: To characterize the shielding design and leakage radiation from a newly released ring gantry linac (Halcyon, Varian Medical Systems). METHODS: To assess the radiation leakage surrounding headshield and the radiation level after the beam stopper, measurements were made with GafChromic films. To evaluate the in-room radiation levels, the radiation leakage in the iso-center plane was measured with a large volume spherical ionization chamber (Exradin A6, Standard Imaging). A lead enclosure was constructed to shield the chamber from the low energy scatter radiation from the room. The radiation level at multiple locations was measured with the MLC fully closed and gantry at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270 and 315 degrees. The leakage radiation passing through multiple concrete slabs with various thickness was recorded in a narrow beam geometry to determine the tenth value layer (TVL). RESULTS: A uniform leakage (<0.05%) at 1m from electron beam line was measured surrounding the linac head with the max leakage measured at the top of the head enclosure. The highest radiation level (<0.08%) was measured near the edge of the beam stopper when projected to the measurement plane. The maximum radiation levels due to the head leakage at 15 locations inside the treatment room were recorded and a radiation map was plotted. The maximum leakage was measured at points that along the electron beam line while the gantry at 90 or 270 degree and at the end of head enclosure (0.314%, 0.4 m from electron beamline). The leakage TVL value is found to be 226 mm in a narrow beam geometry with the concrete density of 2.16g/cm3 or 134.6 lb/cu.ft. CONCLUSION: An overall uniform leakage was measured surrounding linac head. The beam stopper shields the primary radiation with the highest valued measured near the edge of beam stopper. The leakage TVL values are derived and lower than the values reported for conventional C-arm linac.

Low-dose ionizing radiation as a hormetin: experimental observations and therapeutic perspective for age-related disorders
Abstract: 
 Hormesis is any kind of biphasic dose-response when low doses of some agents are beneficial while higher doses are detrimental. Radiation hormesis is the most thoroughly investigated among all hormesis-like phenomena, in particular in biogerontology. In this review, we aimed to summarize research evidence supporting hormesis through exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR). Radiation-induced longevity hormesis has been repeatedly reported in invertebrate models such as C. elegans, Drosophila and flour beetles and in vertebrate models including guinea pigs, mice and rabbits. On the contrary, suppressing natural background radiation was repeatedly found to cause detrimental effects in protozoa, bacteria and flies. We also discussed here the possibility of clinical use of LDIR, predominantly for age-related disorders, e.g., Alzheimerâ€™s disease, for which no remedies are available. There is accumulating evidence that LDIR, such as those commonly used in X-ray imaging including computer tomography, might act as a hormetin. Of course, caution should be exercised when introducing new medical practices, and LDIR therapy is no exception. However, due to the low average residual life expectancy in old patients, the short-term benefits of such interventions (e.g., potential therapeutic effect against dementia) may outweigh their hypothetical delayed risks (e.g., cancer). We argue here that assessment and clinical trials of LDIR treatments should be given priority bearing in mind the enormous economic, social and ethical implications of potentially-treatable, age-related disorders.
