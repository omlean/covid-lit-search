Long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome in preclinical 3D models of the human bronchial epithelium
Abstract: 
 The human bronchial epithelium is the first line of defense against atmospheric particles, pollutants, and respiratory pathogens such as the novel SARS-CoV-2. The epithelial cells form a tight barrier and secrete proteins that are major components of the mucosal immune response. Functional in vitro models of the human lung are essential for screening the epithelial response and assessing the toxicity and barrier crossing of drugs, inhaled particles, and pollutants. However, there is a lack of models to investigate the effect of chronic exposure without resorting to animal testing. Here, we developed a 3D model of the human bronchial epithelium using Calu-3 cell line and demonstrated its viability and functionality for 21 days without subculturing. We investigated the effect of reduced Fetal Bovine Serum supplementation in the basal medium and defined the minimal supplementation needed to maintain a functional epithelium, so that the amount of exogenous serum proteins could be reduced during drug testing. The long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome was fully characterized by quantitative mass spectrometry in two preclinical models using Calu-3 or primary NHBE cells. 408 common secreted proteins were identified while significant differences in protein abundance were observed with time, suggesting that 7-10 days are necessary to establish a mature secretome in the Calu-3 model. The associated Reactome pathways highlight the role of the secreted proteins in the immune response of the bronchial epithelium. We suggest this preclinical 3D model can be used to evaluate the long-term toxicity of drugs or particles on the human bronchial epithelium, and subsequently to investigate their effect on the epithelial cell secretions.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the corneal epithelium of a patient after recovery from COVID-19
Abstract: 
 Purpose To report a case of a patient presenting with unilateral keratouveitis associated with ocular hypertension six weeks after being discharged from the hospital for COVID-19 Ocular specimens were obtained for testing Observations A 69-year-old African American woman developed poor vision while hospitalized for COVID-19 in April but did not seek ophthalmic care until end of May She had an edematous cornea, stromal keratitis, and highly elevated intraocular pressure by June After lack of response to oral valacyclovir, aqueous fluid and swabs of her conjunctiva and limbal epithelium with corneal epithelium anterior to the limbus were sent for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Epithelium from the cornea and limbus was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR;specimens from the other two ocular sites were negative All specimens were negative for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus The patient refused further treatment despite intraocular pressure above 50 mm Hg at last follow-up Conclusions and Importance: Although SARS-CoV-2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been detected by PCR in the conjunctiva and tears of patients with acute respiratory infection, presence in corneal tissue has not been described In addition, no one has studied whether ocular tissues in convalesced patients can harbor viral RNA Here we describe unilateral keratouveitis in a convalesced patient whose corneal epithelium/limbal tissue was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR Further investigation is required to determine whether active viral replication or viral remnants account for this result

Evidence of SARS-CoV2 Entry Protein ACE2 in the Human Nose and Olfactory Bulb
Abstract: 
 Usually, pandemic COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV2, presents with mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, but frequently also with anosmia and neurological symptoms. Virus-cell fusion is mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to the central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human postmortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae, and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells, and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly, ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium. Our findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium, and olfactory bulb. Thus, they are substantial for future studies that aim to elucidate the symptom of SARS-CoV2 induced anosmia via the olfactory pathway.

Effects of cigarette smoking on SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor ACE2 expression in the respiratory epithelium(†)
Abstract: 
 Due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) pandemic, the world is currently facing high morbidity and mortality rates as well as severe disruption to normal societal and social structures. SARS‐CoV‐2 uses the ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In a recent publication of The Journal of Pathology, Liu and coworkers highlight the effects of cigarette smoking on ACE2 expression in the respiratory epithelium. The authors studied the effects of acute cigarette smoke exposure in a murine model and confirmed their findings in human lung tissues and gene expression datasets. Their findings demonstrate that cigarette smoking increases ACE2 expression specifically at the apical surface of the airway epithelium. Smoking cessation resulted in lower ACE2 expression, with implications for attenuating the risk of transmission of the virus. The role of ACE2 expression in the development of COVID‐19 symptoms is still under investigation, with conflicting results from experimental models on the role of ACE2 expression in SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced lung injury. In this commentary, we highlight the implications and limitations of the study of Liu et al as well as future therapeutic strategies directed towards ACE2. © 2020 The Authors.
