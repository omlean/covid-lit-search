Longitudinal profiling of respiratory and systemic immune responses reveals myeloid cell-driven lung inflammation in severe COVID-19
Abstract: 
 Immune response dynamics in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their severe manifestations have largely been studied in circulation. Here, we examined the relationship between immune processes in the respiratory tract and circulation through longitudinal phenotypic, transcriptomic, and cytokine profiling of paired airway and blood samples from patients with severe COVID-19 relative to heathy controls. In COVID-19 airways, T cells exhibited activated, tissue-resident, and protective profiles; higher T cell frequencies correlated with survival and younger age. Myeloid cells in COVID-19 airways featured hyperinflammatory signatures, and higher frequencies of these cells correlated with mortality and older age. In COVID-19 blood, aberrant CD163+ monocytes predominated over conventional monocytes, and were found in corresponding airway samples and in damaged alveoli. High levels of myeloid chemoattractants in airways suggest recruitment of these cells through a CCL2-CCR2 chemokine axis. Our findings provide insights into immune processes driving COVID-19 lung pathology with therapeutic implications for targeting inflammation in the respiratory tract.

Analysis of pathological changes in the epithelium in COVID-19 patient airways
Abstract: 
 Severe COVID-19 patient airways plugged by MUC5AC-containing mucus exhibit hyperplasia of goblet cells, and hypoplasia of multiciliated cells and club cells, as well as significantly reduced CC16 and MUC5B levels, and increased IL-13 levels https://bit ly/2M2NcdO

'From the editor's desk': a new year brings a new volume ... and perhaps a vaccine?
Abstract: 
 "From the editor's desk": a new year brings a new volume and perhaps a vaccine? In opening Volume 53 of the Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences, I am certain many of you will share my own sentiment of looking forward to a new year in which hopefully we will see increased stability and perhaps even movement towards some degree of normalcy;or at the very least a "new normal" to which we must adapt in the COVID-era Volume 53/1 highlights the broad spectrum of disciplines represented in the Journal, including in this issue (but not limited to) pathology, odontology, chemometrics, organic chemistry, questioned documents and digital toolmarks [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Australian Journal of Forensic Sciences is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )
