The possibility of the aerosol infection of corona disease covid-19-analysis from the viewpoint of particle technology
Abstract: 
 Aerosol infection issues by COVID-19 were discussed from the viewpoint of particle technology, and the following conclusions were obtained: 1) Number of virus contained in a 10 μm droplet is very few, only 1 virus per 2000 droplets, whereas 0 5 virus in a 100 μm droplet, if 106 copies/mL of viral load in saliva is assumed 2) Droplets larger than 100 μm can quickly settle down by gravity 3) The possibility of aerosol infection is very low unless in unusual environments 4) Mask is very effective, but the leakage from the space between mask and face has risk in heavy exhalation © 2020 Society of Powder Technology All rights reserved

Coronavirus Infections of Animals: Future Risks to Humans
Abstract: 
 Coronaviruseshave tremendous evolutionary potential, and three major outbreaks of new human coronavirus infections have occurred in the recent history of humankind In this paper, the patterns of occurrence of new zoonotic coronavirus infections and the role of bioveterinary control in preventing their potential outbreaks in the future are determined The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in companion animals is considered Diverse human activities may trigger various interactions between animal species and their viruses, sometimes causing the emergence of new viral pathogens In addition, the possibility of using probiotics for the control of viral infections in animals is discussed

Groundhog Day and the Epoché
Abstract: 
 The author focuses on impact of coronavirus on duties of nurses and doctors, people unemployed at food banks and incompetence at helm of national government Topics discussed include reflection on biopolitics and biopower inspired by the virus, post humanism which relocates bodies between complexity and simplicity and pastor Robert Jeffress who conjured with possibility of coronavirus is judgement from God

Letter to the Editor: Microbiota in the Respiratory System-A Possible Explanation to Age and Sex Variability in Susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
Abstract: 
 The Human respiratory tract is colonized by a variety of microbes and the microbiota change as we age In this perspective, literature support is presented for the hypothesis that the respiratory system microbiota could explain the differential age and sex breakdown amongst COVID-19 patients The number of patients in the older and elderly adult group is higher than the other age groups The perspective presents the possibility that certain genera of bacteria present in the respiratory system microbiota in children and young adults could be directly or through eliciting an immune response from the host, prevent full-fledged infection of SARS-CoV-2 The possibility also exists that the microbiota in older adults and the elderly population have bacteria that make it easier for the virus to cause infection I call upon the scientific community to investigate the link between human microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to further understand the viral pathogenesis
