Immunologic Pathophysiology and Airway Remodeling Mechanism in Severe Asthma: Focused on IgE-Mediated Pathways
Abstract: 
 Despite the expansion of the understanding in asthma pathophysiology and the continual advances in disease management, a small subgroup of patients remains partially controlled or refractory to standard treatments. Upon the identification of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and other inflammatory mediators, investigations and developments of targeted agents have thrived. Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the circulating IgE, which in turn impedes and reduces subsequent releases of the proinflammatory mediators. In the past decade, omalizumab has been proven to be efficacious and well-tolerated in the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma in both trials and real-life studies, most notably in reducing exacerbation rates and corticosteroid use. While growing evidence has demonstrated that omalizumab may be potentially beneficial in treating other allergic diseases, its indication remains confined to treating severe allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Future efforts may be bestowed on determining the optimal length of omalizumab treatment, seeking biomarkers that could better predict treatment response and as well as extending its indications.

COVID-19 related dermatosis in November 2019. Could this case be Italy's patient zero?
Abstract: 
 Milan, the largest city in northern Italy, was one of the first European metropolitan areas to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed skin biopsies of patients from Milan with dermatoses and positive PCR swabs for SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of the infection (1,2). The results were compared to skin biopsies of 20 COVID-19 non-diagnosed patients with dermatoses, who were at high-risk of COVID-19 infection.

Optimizing Airway Surgery in COVID 19 Era
Abstract: 
 Otorhinolaryngologists, particularly dealing with airway cases, are subjected to highest risk of COVID 19 aerosolisation, self infection and transmission. Moreover, airway cases, which mostly present as emergency, cannot be deferred. Being a tertiary airway centre and having received a number of airway cases, most of them requiring prompt surgical intervention, our airway surgery and anaesthesiology team had to work in conjunction to adapt and readapt the practice over the past few months, striving to achieve effective airway surgery protocols, to minimize exposure and prevent transmission of COVID 19. To enlist the encountered airway cases during COVID 19 pandemic and to highlight the important inclusions and adaptations in executing the airway surgeries. A retrospective observational study of 7 months duration was carried out. This is a single institutional study, where the sample included the primary as well the referred airway cases. Apart from Tracheotomy, Foreign body bronchus removal, Dilatation of Laryngotracheal Stenosis (LTS) and excision of Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP), we also have had the experience to deal with congenital Laryngo-tracheo-oesophageal Cleft (LTOC) Type III b, Thyroid surgery to relieve tracheal compression and Bilateral Choanal Atresia repair during the last 7 months. Routine 2 weeks follow up of the patients have been favourable, as there has not been any report or clinical features of transmission of COVID 19. As the airway surgeries could be executed with the incorporation of certain change in practice and as the follow up revealed no evidence of transmission, we attempt to contribute to airway best practice guideline for maintaining the safety of patients and health professionals.
