Long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome in preclinical 3D models of the human bronchial epithelium
Abstract: 
 The human bronchial epithelium is the first line of defense against atmospheric particles, pollutants, and respiratory pathogens such as the novel SARS-CoV-2. The epithelial cells form a tight barrier and secrete proteins that are major components of the mucosal immune response. Functional in vitro models of the human lung are essential for screening the epithelial response and assessing the toxicity and barrier crossing of drugs, inhaled particles, and pollutants. However, there is a lack of models to investigate the effect of chronic exposure without resorting to animal testing. Here, we developed a 3D model of the human bronchial epithelium using Calu-3 cell line and demonstrated its viability and functionality for 21 days without subculturing. We investigated the effect of reduced Fetal Bovine Serum supplementation in the basal medium and defined the minimal supplementation needed to maintain a functional epithelium, so that the amount of exogenous serum proteins could be reduced during drug testing. The long-term evolution of the epithelial cell secretome was fully characterized by quantitative mass spectrometry in two preclinical models using Calu-3 or primary NHBE cells. 408 common secreted proteins were identified while significant differences in protein abundance were observed with time, suggesting that 7-10 days are necessary to establish a mature secretome in the Calu-3 model. The associated Reactome pathways highlight the role of the secreted proteins in the immune response of the bronchial epithelium. We suggest this preclinical 3D model can be used to evaluate the long-term toxicity of drugs or particles on the human bronchial epithelium, and subsequently to investigate their effect on the epithelial cell secretions.

Evidence of SARS-CoV2 Entry Protein ACE2 in the Human Nose and Olfactory Bulb
Abstract: 
 Usually, pandemic COVID-19 disease, caused by SARS-CoV2, presents with mild respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, but frequently also with anosmia and neurological symptoms. Virus-cell fusion is mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with their organ expression pattern determining viral tropism. Clinical presentation suggests rapid viral dissemination to the central nervous system leading frequently to severe symptoms including viral meningitis. Here, we provide a comprehensive expression landscape of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins across human postmortem nasal and olfactory tissue. Sagittal sections through the human nose complemented with immunolabelling of respective cell types represent different anatomically defined regions including olfactory epithelium, respiratory epithelium of the nasal conchae and the paranasal sinuses along with the hardly accessible human olfactory bulb. ACE2 can be detected in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the respiratory epithelium of the nasal septum, the nasal conchae, and the paranasal sinuses. ACE2 is located in the sustentacular cells and in the glandular cells in the olfactory epithelium as well as in the basal cells, glandular cells, and epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. Intriguingly, ACE2 is not expressed in mature or immature olfactory receptor neurons and basal cells in the olfactory epithelium. Similarly, ACE2 is not localized in the olfactory receptor neurons albeit the olfactory bulb is positive. Vice versa, TMPRSS2 can also be detected in the sustentacular cells and the glandular cells of the olfactory epithelium. Our findings provide the basic anatomical evidence for the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the human nose, olfactory epithelium, and olfactory bulb. Thus, they are substantial for future studies that aim to elucidate the symptom of SARS-CoV2 induced anosmia via the olfactory pathway.
