Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 on Renin Angiotensin System Inhibitor Long-Term Treatment: An Observational Study Showing that Things Are Not Always as They Seem
Abstract: 
 INTRODUCTION: At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, controversial data were reported concerning angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) that induced a number of physicians to stop using them in patients with COVID-19. Although large-scale studies have ruled out this concern, it is common experience that patients with COVID-19 taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs are at increased risk of death. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons for this apparently high mortality rate. METHODS: During the first wave of the pandemic, we conducted a field study of 427 consecutive patients with COVID-19 upon their admission to the emergency department of a hospital in one of the most severely hit cities in northern Italy, and 30 days later. The disease was defined as being mild, moderate or severe on the basis of clinical, laboratory and imaging data, and a multivariate model was used to analyse the determinants of mortality. RESULTS: Within 30 days of admission, 31.6% of the patients treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs and 15.2% of those not treated with these drugs had died. Multivariate analysis showed that the determinants of mortality were age (p = 0.0001), hypertension (p = 0.0120) and diabetes (p = 0.0129), whereas ACE inhibitors or ARBs had no effect on mortality. There was no significant difference between the patients treated with ACE inhibitors and those treated with ARBs. CONCLUSION: The apparently increased mortality of patients with COVID-19 receiving long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARBs is not due to the drugs themselves, but to the conditions associated with their use.

Changing Management of Hematological Malignancies With COVID-19: Statement and Recommendations of the Lebanese Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion
Abstract: 
 COVID-19 caused by SARS-Cov-2 is a devastating infection in patients with hematological malignancies In 2018, the Lebanese Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion (LSHBT) updated the guidelines for the management of hematological malignancies in Lebanon In 2019, it was followed by a second update Given the rapidly changing evidence and general situation for COVID-19, the LSHBT established some recommendations and suggestions for the management of the patients with hematological malignancies taking into account the Lebanese condition, economic situation, and the facts that SARS-Cov-2 infection has apparently been devastating In this article we present recommendations and proposals to reduce or to manage SARS-Cov-2 infection in the patients with myeloid and lymphoid hematological malignancies

Epidemiology Compartmental Models—SIR, SEIR, and SEIR with Intervention
Abstract: 
 The process of decision-making when dealing with infectious diseases is firmly based on mathematical modeling nowadays One usual approach is to consider the adoption of compartmental methods such as SIR and SEIR and a large number of corresponding variations for modeling and prediction epidemic time series Nevertheless, the COVID-19 epidemic characteristics and curves are apparently challenging the results obtained by these models This chapter presents the results of two traditional compartmental models, SIR (Susceptible—Infected–Recovered) and SEIR (Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Recovered), and an adapted version of the SEIR, called SEIR with Intervention, which captures the impact of containment measures for the dynamics of the infection rate The analysis is performed for five countries: China, United States, Brazil, Italy, and Singapore, each of them with specific characteristics of dealing with the pandemic A sequence of results is presented, considering different parameters, in order to understand the feasibility of application for each model © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG

An exploratory study of selenium status in healthy individuals and in patients with COVID-19 in a south Indian population: The case for adequate selenium status
Abstract: 
 The acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has affected millions of individuals, causing major health and economic disruptions worldwide. The pandemic is still raging, with a second and third wave in a few countries, while new infections steadily rise in India. Nutrition and immune status are two critical aspects of fighting the virus successfully. Recently, selenium status was reported to positively correlate with the survival of patients with COVID-19 compared with non-survivors. We analyzed the blood serum levels in 30 apparently healthy individuals and in 30 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the southern part of India. The patients showed significantly lower selenium levels of 69.2 ± 8.7 ng/mL than controls 79.1 ± 10.9 ng/mL. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.0003). Interestingly, the control group showed a borderline level of selenium, suggesting that the level of this micronutrient is not optimum in the population studied. The results of this exploratory study pave the way for further research in a larger population and suggest that selenium supplementation may be helpful in reducing the effects of the virus.

Misinformation Analysis During Covid-19 Pandemic
Abstract: 
 Online diffusion of misinformation has gained extreme attention in the research from past few years Moreover, during ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the proliferation of misinformation became more prominent In this paper, a comparison of two feature engineering techniques, namely term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) and word embeddings (doc2vec), is done over different machine learning classifiers A Web scraper is developed for fact-checking Web site, Snopes com, to extract labeled news related to Covid-19 Although the size of dataset is less, the body content under headlines contains large amount of text Therefore, the model works well with both the feature engineering techniques and machine learning algorithms Apparently, we obtained best accuracy of 95 38% with tf-idf on decision tree and same accuracy of 90 77% using doc2vec on support vector machine and logistic regression machine learning classifier © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd
