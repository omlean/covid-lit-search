COVID-19 Outbreak in Malaysia: Decoding D614G Mutation of SARS-CoV-2 Virus Isolated from an Asymptomatic Case in Pahang
Abstract: 
 SARS-CoV-2 is a very transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus which detected in Malaysia in January 2020. Nevertheless, the sample from Malaysia is still under-sequenced. Hence lacking clarity of the circulating strain in Malaysia leads to a deadlock in understanding the virus infectivity. This study aimed to investigate the genome identity of circulating COVID-19 strains in Pahang and understand disease epidemiology during the pandemic. This study leveraged high-throughput sequencing analysis for the whole genome sequencing and implemented bioinformatic technique for the analysis. Here we reported that the virus with D614G mutation in Spike protein circulates in a few Malaysia states before the Sivagangga cluster announced in Kedah in July 2020. This mutated virus includes our virus sample isolated in April 2020 from an asymptomatic patient in Pahang. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we discovered the origin of our sample Pahang/IIUM91 was not related to Sivagangga cluster. Here, we have generated 3D structure model of Pahang/IIUM91 Spike protein. D614G mutation in Pahang/IIUM91 Spike protein increases viral stability and flexibility, hence render higher infectivity. Collectively, our results suggest for the establishment of a complete SARS-CoV-2 genome database in Malaysia. Hence, more research should be established to learn the behaviour of this virus.

Milk Peptides as Novel Multi-Targeted Therapeutic Candidates for SARS-CoV2
Abstract: 
 The COVID-19, an acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV2 is a major catastrophic event of the twenty first century. Relentless efforts for the development of effective pharmaco-therapeutics are in progress but the respite is the development of effective vaccines. However, monotherapy might not always exhibit complete efficacy and may culminate in the rapid evolution of drug-resistant viral strains. Hence, simultaneous modulation of multiple druggable targets not only enhances therapeutic efficacy but also quell the prospects of mutant viruses. Currently, milk peptides have bloomed beyond just being a quintessential part of nutrition to prominent therapeutic implications in human health and diseases. Hence, we have focused on colostrum/milk peptides as they have already been acknowledged for their high potency, target specificity with significantly low or no side effects and bio-toleration. The results presented provide a conceptual strategy for the rational designing of prospective multitargeted peptide inhibitors for SARS-CoV2.

The cardiovascular aspect of COVID-19
Abstract: 
 The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2), has hit the world very hard by affecting millions of people across countries hence posing a major health threat on a global scale. This novel virus is thought to enter and cause infection in its host through the attachment of its structural protein known as the S-glycoprotein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 with its consequences globally, it is mandatory that health caregivers and researchers across all disciplines abreast themselves with the potential effects that this novel virus may have on their fields and the medical society at large. During the infection, the cardiovascular system is affected by unknown pathomechanistic processes, hence accounting for an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among COVID-19 patients. As cardiovascular researchers, we are more concerned about the cardiovascular aspect of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Hence, this concise review addresses these aspects where CVD as a risk factor of COVID-19, the prevalence of CVDs in COVID-19, and the potential cardiovascular disorders which may evolve owing to COVID-19 are discussed. A better understanding of these issues will be pivotal to improve cardiovascular health during this SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Immunotoxic role of organophosphates: An unseen risk escalating SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity
Abstract: 
 Consistent gathering of immunotoxic substances on earth is a serious global issue affecting people under pathogenic stress. Organophosphates are among such hazardous compounds that are ubiquitous in nature. They fuel oxidative stress to impair antiviral immune response in living entities. Aside, organophosphates promote cytokine burst and pyroptosis in broncho-alveolar chambers leading to severe respiratory ailments. At present, we witness COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. Infection triggers cytokine storm coupled with inflammatory manifestations and pulmonary disorders in patients. Since organophosphate-exposure promotes necroinflammation and respiratory troubles hence during current pandemic situation, additional exposure to such chemicals can exacerbate inflammatory outcome and pulmonary maladies in patients, or pre-exposure to organophosphates might turn-out to be a risk factor for compromised immunity. Fortunately, antioxidants alleviate organophosphate-induced immunosuppression and hence under co-exposure circumstances, dietary intake of antioxidants would be beneficial to boost immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Polyvaccine: joining the links in the cascade of type 1 diabetes
Abstract: 
 The incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), an autoimmune disorder, has ascended considerably with around 98,200 and 15,900 incidents in children below 15 years of age, globally and in India, respectively. This is typically due to environmental changes leading to genetic modifications. Also, T1DM encompasses the presence of autoantigens and many other etiologies which can be targeted by proper immunization. In this paper, we consciously discuss and collate various candidate triggers of islet autoimmunity and other factors expected to promote progression of T1DM. This paper bridges all the mechanisms caused by these factors and linking them with each other. We have also highlighted on the novel corona virus as a trigger for T1DM. Finally, we suggest that an amalgamated model of polyvaccine can batter the condition by inducing protection against various triggers of T1DM.
