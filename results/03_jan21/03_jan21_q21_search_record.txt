 Corticosteroids Treatment of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Propensity Score Matching StudyAbstract: 
The role of corticosteroids in the treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is controversial. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of adjuvant corticosteroids treatment on the outcome of patients with COVID-19 (n=966), using Propensity Score Matching to adjust for potential differences between the corticosteroids group (n=289) and the non-corticosteroids group (n=677). Analysis of data without adjusting differences in baseline characteristics indicated that the proportion of mechanical ventilation and the mortality was higher in the corticosteroids treatment group in total or severe/critical patients. The duration of viral shedding was longer in the non-corticosteroids treatment group in total or general/mild patients. After adjusting the difference between the corticosteroids and non-corticosteroids treatment group, the analysis revealed that the use of corticosteroids had no effect on the duration of viral shedding, in-hospital mortality or 28-day mortality.

 Timing of corticosteroids impacts mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patientsAbstract: 
The optimal timing of initiating corticosteroid treatment in hospitalized patients is unknown. We aimed to assess the relationship between timing of initial corticosteroid treatment and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. In this observational study through medical record analysis, we quantified the mortality benefit of corticosteroids in two equally matched groups of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We subsequently evaluated the timing of initiating corticosteroids and its effect on mortality in all patients receiving corticosteroids. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected and employed for multivariable regression analyses. 1461 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were analyzed. Of these, 760 were also matched into two equal groups based on having received corticosteroid therapy. Patients receiving corticosteroids had a lower risk of death than those who did not (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.67-0.90; p = 0.01). Timing of corticosteroids was assessed for all 615 patients receiving corticosteroids during admission. Patients receiving first dose of corticosteroids > 72 h into hospitalization had a lower risk of death compared to patients with first dose at earlier time intervals (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.82; p = 0.003). There was a mortality benefit in patients with > 7 days of symptom onset to initiation of corticosteroids (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.95; p = 0.03). In patients receiving oxygen therapy, corticosteroids reduced risk of death in mechanically ventilated patients (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24-0.60; p < 0.001) but not in patients on high-flow or other oxygen therapy (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20-1.07; p = 0.07) and (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.35-2.00; p = 0.69), respectively. Timing of corticosteroids initiation was related to in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. Time from symptom onset > 7 days should trigger initiation of corticosteroids. In the absence of invasive mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids should be initiated if the patient remains hospitalized at 72 h. Hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen therapy should not be a trigger for initiation of corticosteroids unless the timing is appropriate.

 Corticosteroids for CAP, influenza and COVID-19: when, how and benefits or harm?Abstract: 
PURPOSE: Corticosteroids have been considered in medicine for a long time, and they are broadly prescribed. In infectious diseases, corticosteroids have been regarded as a thread due to their immunosuppressive effects and therefore their anti-inflammatory properties. MAIN: In recent years, there have been several studies published that aimed to determine the role of corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), because, despite significant advances in new antibiotics and supportive care, deaths of patients with CAP remain unacceptably high. While the 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) CAP guidelines did not mention the use of corticosteroids in the management of CAP, the recently published 2019 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommended their use in patients with septic shock refractory to vasopressors and fluid resuscitation. Regarding viral infection, the use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza has shown to be associated with significantly higher mortality and higher incidence of nosocomial infection, while in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) there is a good body of evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids in terms of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of corticosteroids has been considered as a potential alternative co-adjuvant treatment in patients with pneumonia. In patients with COVID-19, the evidence is quite strong and there is a clear benefit of the use of corticosteroids in those patients presenting severe forms of disease.
