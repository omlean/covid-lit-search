 A Software Tool for Calculating the Uncertainty of Diagnostic Accuracy MeasuresAbstract: 
Screening and diagnostic tests are applied for the classification of people into diseased and non-diseased populations. Although diagnostic accuracy measures are used to evaluate the correctness of classification in clinical research and practice, there has been limited research on their uncertainty. The objective for this work was to develop a tool for calculating the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures, as diagnostic accuracy is fundamental to clinical decision-making. For this reason, the freely available interactive program Diagnostic Uncertainty has been developed in the Wolfram Language. The program provides six modules with nine submodules for calculating and plotting the standard combined, measurement and sampling uncertainty and the resultant confidence intervals of various diagnostic accuracy measures of screening or diagnostic tests, which measure a normally distributed measurand, applied at a single point in time to samples of non-diseased and diseased populations. This is done for differing sample sizes, mean and standard deviation of the measurand, diagnostic threshold and standard measurement uncertainty of the test. The application of the program is demonstrated with an illustrative example of glucose measurements in samples of diabetic and non-diabetic populations, that shows the calculation of the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures. The presented interactive program is user-friendly and can be used as a flexible educational and research tool in medical decision-making, to calculate and explore the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures.

 Health Care Professionals' Confidence and Preferences for Diagnostic Assays for SARS-CoV-2: A Global StudyAbstract: 
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent requirement for novel diagnostic tests that determine infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the development of an immune response against it. The perspective of end users on the characteristics and clinical use of these assays has not been previously considered. Methods: We surveyed 17,186 health care professions (HCPs) in 29 countries to gauge opinion on the design, use, diagnostic impact and diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19 tests. Results were correlated with national statistics on the burden of disease and testing in individual countries. Results: HCPs overwhelmingly recognized the importance of COVID-19 tests but 37.1% were unsure of the appropriate timing of investigations relative to disease symptoms. Confidence in the diagnostic accuracy of assays varied inversely with COVID-19-related mortality in individual countries but had no relationship with the total number of tests performed. There was global consensus that the most important impact of positive antigen and antibody testing was confidence in returning to work following recovery. Saliva was the preferred sampling fluid for COVID-19 diagnostic tests in all groups surveyed. Conclusions: HCP input can ensure novel assays are fit for purpose in varied global health care settings, but HCPs may require support to effectively use novel diagnostics thus minimizing waste when supplies are limited.
