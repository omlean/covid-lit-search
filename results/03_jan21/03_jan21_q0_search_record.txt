 Surviving the Rookie Virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2): The Immunopathology of a SARS-CoV2 Infection.Abstract: 
Until July 29th, the number of confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases worldwide has risen to over 16 million, within which 655 k deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) emerges as the 11th global pandemic disease, showing the highest infectivity and lowest infection fatality rate. In this review, we compare the immunopathology among SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and SARS-CoV2. SARS-CoV2 is similar to SARS-CoV; it can cause lymphocytopenia and a rising granulocyte count. Here we point out the human body and concentrated society make for an excellent incubator for virus evolution. Most research energies put into developing the SARS-CoV2 vaccine are trying to block virus infection. Sixty-five percent of severe patients die with multiple organ failure, inflammation, and cytokine storm, which indicates that the patient's immune system maintains functionality. Finding a way to trigger the specific T cell subset and plasmablast in our body is the best shot to get away with SARS-CoV2.

 Identification of multipotent drugs for COVID-19 therapeutics with the evaluation of their SARS-CoV2 inhibitory activityAbstract: 
The SARS-CoV2 is a highly contagious pathogen that causes COVID-19 disease. It has affected millions of people globally with an average lethality of â¼3%. There is an urgent need of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. In the current studies, we have used bioinformatics techniques to screen the FDA approved drugs against nine SARS-CoV2 proteins to identify drugs for repurposing. Additionally, we analyzed if the identified molecules can also affect the human proteins whose expression in lung changed during SARS-CoV2 infection. Targeting such genes may also be a beneficial strategy to curb disease manifestation. We have identified 74 molecules that can bind to various SARS-CoV2 and human host proteins. We experimentally validated our in-silico predictions using vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV2 virus. Interestingly, many of our predicted molecules viz. capreomycin, celecoxib, mefloquine, montelukast, and nebivolol showed good activity (IC50) against SARS-CoV2. We hope that these studies may help in the development of new therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19.

 Development of new vaccine target against SARS-CoV2 using envelope (E) protein: An evolutionary, molecular modeling and docking based studyAbstract: 
COVID-19 is one of the fatal pandemic throughout the world. For cellular fusion, its antigenic peptides are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coil➔helix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher ΔG values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility. E-protein can therefore be targeted as a potential vaccine target against SARS-CoV2.
