 Public Perspectives on Anti-Diabetic Drugs: Exploratory Analysis of Twitter PostsAbstract: 
BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a major global public health issue where self-management is critical to reducing disease burden. Social media has been a powerful tool to understand public perceptions. Public perception of the drugs used for the treatment of diabetes may be useful for orienting interventions to increase adherence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the public perceptions of anti-diabetic drugs through the analysis of health-related tweets mentioning such medications. METHODS: This study uses an infoveillance social listening approach to monitor public discourse using Twitter data. We coded 4000 tweets from January 1, 2019 to October 1, 2019 containing key terms related to anti-diabetic drugs by using qualitative content analysis. Tweets were coded for whether they were truly about an anti-diabetic drug and whether they were health-related. Health-related tweets were further coded based on who was tweeting, which anti-diabetic drug was being tweeted about, and the content discussed in the tweet. The main outcome of the analysis was the themes identified by analyzing the content of health-related tweets on anti-diabetic drugs. RESULTS: We identified 1664 health-related tweets on 33 anti-diabetic drugs. A quarter (415/1664) of the tweets were confirmed to have been from people with diabetes, 17.9% (298/1664) from people posting about someone else, and 2.7% (45/1664) from health care professionals. However, the role of the tweeter was unidentifiable in two-thirds of the tweets. We identified 13 themes, with the health consequences of the cost of anti-diabetic drugs being the most extensively discussed, followed by the efficacy and availability. We also identified issues that patients may conceal from health care professionals, such as purchasing medications from unofficial sources. CONCLUSIONS: This study uses an infoveillance approach using Twitter data to explore public perceptions related to anti-diabetic drugs. This analysis gives an insight into the real-life issues that an individual faces when taking anti-diabetic drugs, and such findings may be incorporated into health policies to improve compliance and efficacy. This study suggests that there is a fear of not having access to anti-diabetic drugs due to cost or physical availability and highlights the impact of the sacrifices made to access anti-diabetic drugs. Along with screening for diabetes-related health issues, health care professionals should also ask their patients about any non–health-related concerns regarding their anti-diabetic drugs. The positive tweets about dietary changes indicate that people with type 2 diabetes may be more open to self-management than what the health care professionals believe.

 Epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in diabetic versus non-diabetic patientsAbstract: 
OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND: People with diabetes (PWD) are one of the high-risk groups for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, increasing the disease mortality. This study was aimed to compare the epidemiological characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in diabetic versus non-diabetic individuals. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, the epidemiological characteristics of the two groups of diabetic (n=1365) and non-diabetic (n=15,026) subjects with definite diagnosis of COVID-19 in the southwestern region of Iran were compared. All clinical signs and comorbidities of the patients were evaluated. Chi-square test was used to examine the differences in qualitative variables between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. RESULTS: Of 16,391 enrolled subjects, 8.3% had diabetes, and 28.3% of COVID-19-related deaths occurred in diabetics. Also, the mortality rate among diabetics was reported as 14.3%. The average age of diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients was 59 and 37 years, respectively. The odds of fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, and underlying diseases, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, immune deficiency, and hyperlipidemia, were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics. CONCLUSION: Diabetes is associated with increased mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 and is considered as a major risk factor for COVID-19 infection, posing a major public health challenge for health policymakers in managing and controlling the disease. Therefore, development of prevention and treatment strategies aimed at reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in diabetes patients is of significant importance.

 Impact of lockdown COVID-19 on metabolic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy peopleAbstract: 
AIMS: The impact of prolonged COVID-19 lockdown on metabolic control in type 2 diabetes patients and healthy individuals has not exactly been known. We aimed to evaluate the change in body weight and metabolic control in type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic healthy subjects during the prolonged lockdown period. METHODS: Diabetic (n = 85), and age-and sex-matched non-diabetic subjects (n = 55) were included in this prospective study. Body mass index and metabolic parameters were compared between before and 6th months of lockdown. Changes in values were evaluated using the difference before and after lockdown. RESULTS: Age (54.81 ± 10.53 vs. 52.61 ± 4.88 years), gender (female, 68.2% vs. 56.4%) and, BMI (33.44 ± 6.48 vs. 31.63 ± 3.57 kg/m2) were similar between groups (p > 0.05). Before and after lockdown, BMI increased both in non-diabetic (0.54 ± 0.95 kg) and diabetic groups (1.91 ± 5.48 kg) (p > 0.05). Increase in HbA1c was more in diabetic than in non-diabetic groups (0.71 ± 1.35 vs. 0.02 ± 0.19%, p = 0.002). Glucose, LDL-C, and TG increased in diabetic (39.69 ± 74.69, 7.60 ± 34.33, and 58.21 ± 133.54 mg/dl, p < 0.05) whereas non significantly decreased in non-diabetic group (-0.51 ± 4.40, -3.52 ± 14.53, and -6.47 ± 41.77 mg/dl, respectively. After adjusting BMI, increase in blood glucose (p = 0.021), HbA1c (p = 0.018), and TG (p = 0.041) levels were more in diabetic than non-diabetic group. Duration of diabetes was an independent predictor of the change in HbA1c (OR: 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8, p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Body weight gain was observed in type 2 diabetic patients and healthy subjects. This is the first study to show that prolonged lockdown COVID-19 pandemic worsened glucose regulation and increased TG level in diabetes mellitus independent of weight gain.
