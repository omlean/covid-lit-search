 Response to comments on: Surgical ethics during a pandemic: moving into the unknown?Abstract: 
Dear Editor We welcome the letter from Dr Sheah, which raises important points, including that the COVID-19 pandemic is more than just a medical crisis which has exposed 'massive inequalities in wealth, income and power' Dr Sheah also correctly notes that a health service borne from solidarity with the most vulnerable in society 'requires a sense of unity beyond what we have historically displayed' Dr Sheah further observes that 'it is science and not mere ideology , which will give us hope as we face uncertainties around the pandemic' Some ideologies may indeed be problematic, but we would nevertheless emphasize that science alone will not provide the solutions Science itself is a tool that can be used for good or for ill, and how we use science matters as much as the science itself Questions about how we should use it are external to science itself As we noted in a BMJ editorial 1 , the UK government may insist it is 'following the science' but 'this implies that the science alone will tell us what to do Not only does this rhetoric shift the responsibility for difficult decisions on to 'the science', it is also wrong Science may provide evidence on which to base decisions, but our values will determine what we do with that evidence and how we select the evidence to use It is disingenuous and misleading to imply that value-free science leads the way' What we need is close interaction between science and ethics-not the dominance of one The problems we collectively face and the solutions we must collectively craft are not just about science;they require just science

 Teaching Data Science in Political Science: Integrating Methods with Substantive CurriculumAbstract: 
The importance of data science in society today is undeniable, and now is the time to prepare data science talent (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2018) Data science demands collaboration, but collaboration within political science departments has been weak in teaching data science Bridging substantive and methods courses can critically aid in teaching data science because it facilitates this collaboration Our innovation is to integrate data science into both substantive and methods courses through a dedicated data science course and modules on data science topics taught in substantive courses This approach allows not only for more opportunities for teaching and practice of data science methods but also helps students to understand how social, economic, and political biases and incentives can affect their data

 When Science Denial Meets Epistemic Understanding: Fostering a Research Agenda for Science EducationAbstract: 
Science denial has a long history of causing harm in contemporary society when ignored. Recent discussions of science denial suggest that correcting people’s false beliefs rarely has an impact on eliminating the adherence to false beliefs and assumptions, which is called the backfire effect. This paper brings the backfire effect within the context of science denial to the attention of science education researchers and practitioners and discusses the potential role(s) of epistemic understanding of knowledge production in science in dealing with the rejection of scientific evidence and claims in science classrooms. The use of epistemic understanding of knowledge production in science with a focus on avoiding the backfire effect may increase the potential for science education research to produce fruitful strategies which advance students’ attitudes toward science and deepen students’ understanding of how science works through divergent perspectives. There are some areas that need to be focused on and investigated for their potential to combat science denial and the backfire effect while foregrounding the role(s) epistemic understanding of knowledge production for science instruction. These areas include expanding ways of knowing and marking the boundary between the scientific way of knowing and other ways of knowing at the same time, comparing claims and arguments that derive from different frameworks, teaching about the power and limitations of science, and bringing different and similar ways science is done to students’ attention.
