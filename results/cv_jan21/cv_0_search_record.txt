 Targets and strategies for vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 
Abstract: 
The SARS-CoV-2, previously called a novel coronavirus, that broke out in the Wuhan city of China caused a significant number of morbidity and mortality in the world. It is spreading at peak levels since the first case reported and the need for vaccines is in immense demand globally. Numerous treatment and vaccination strategies that were previously employed for other pathogens including coronaviruses are now beingbeen adopted to guide the formulation of new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.Several vaccine targets can be utilized for the development ofthe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this review, wehighlightedthe potential of various antigenic targets and other modes of formulating an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. There are a varying number of challenges encountered during developing the most effective vaccines, andmeasures for tackling such challenges will assist in fast pace development of vaccines. This review will give a concise overview of various aspects of the vaccine development process against SARS-CoV-2 including 1) potential antigen targets 2) different vaccination strategies from conventional to novel platforms, 3) ongoing clinical trials, 4) varying challenges encountered during developing the most effective vaccine and the futuristicapproaches.

 Development of new vaccine target against SARS-CoV2 using envelope (E) protein: An evolutionary, molecular modeling and docking based study 
Abstract: 
COVID-19 is one of the fatal pandemic throughout the world. For cellular fusion, its antigenic peptides are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coil➔helix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher ΔG values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility. E-protein can therefore be targeted as a potential vaccine target against SARS-CoV2.

 Review on Up-to-Date Status of Candidate Vaccines for COVID-19 Disease 
Abstract: 
The global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and poses serious threats to public health and economic stability throughout the world Thus, to protect the global population, developing safe and effective vaccines is mandatory to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic Since genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have similarity and use the same receptor (ACE2), it is important to learn from the development of SARS-CoV-1 vaccines for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines Normally vaccine development takes 10-15 years but vaccine development against SARS-CoV2 is going on at a very fast pace resulting in almost breakthrough methods of vaccine development by several research institutions The whole process of vaccine development including clinical trials gets shortened and may be fast tracked to 15-18 months Global collaborations and increased research efforts among the scientific community have led to more than 214 candidate vaccines globally The current review highlights the different approaches and technologies used around the world for the design and development of the vaccines and also focuses on the recent status of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates under development by various institutions to combat the world threat of COVID-19 pandemic

 Rare SARS-CoV-2 antibody development in cancer patients 
Abstract: 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody development and immunity will be crucial for the further course of the pandemic. Until now, it has been assumed that patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop antibodies as has been the case with other coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In the present study, we analyzed the development of antibodies in 77 patients with an oncologic diagnosis 26 days after positive RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV2. RT-qPCR and anti-SARS-CoV2-antibody methods from BGI (MGIEasy Magnetic Beads Virus DNA/RNA Extraction Kit) and Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay) were used, respectively, according to the manufacturers' specifications. Surprisingly, antibody development was detected in only 6 of 77 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID-19. Despite multiple testing, the remaining patients did not show measurable antibody concentrations in subsequent tests. These results undermine the previous hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 infections are regularly associated with antibody development and cast doubt on the provided immunity to COVID-19. Understanding the adaptive and humoral response to SARS-CoV2 will play a key role in vaccine development and gaining further knowledge on the pathogenesis.
