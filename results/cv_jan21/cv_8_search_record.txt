 Diabetes predicts severity of COVID-19 infection in a retrospective cohort: A mediatory role of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein 
Abstract: 
Diabetes is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. We investigated if the association of diabetes and COVID-19 severity may be mediated by inflammation. We also hypothesized that this increased risk may extend to prediabetes. Hospitalized patients in Singapore with COVID-19 were subdivided into three groups in a retrospective cohort: normoglycemia (HbA1c: &#8804;5.6%), prediabetes (HbA1c: 5.7%-6.4%) and diabetes (HbA1c: &#8805;6.5%). The primary outcome of severe COVID-19 was defined by respiratory rate &#8805;30, SpO2 &#8804;93% or intensive care unit admission. The association between clinical factors on severe COVID-19 outcome was analyzed by cox regression. Adjusted mediation analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) on the relationship between diabetes and severe COVID-19 was performed. Of 1042 hospitalized patients, mean age 39 ± 11 years, 13% had diabetes, 9% prediabetes and 78% normoglycemia. Severe COVID-19 occurred in 4.9% of subjects. Compared to normoglycemia, diabetes was significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on both univariate (hazard ratio [HR]: 9.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.54-17.84; p < .001) and multivariate analysis (HR: 3.99; 95% CI: 1.92-8.31; p < .001), while prediabetes was not a risk factor (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.22-4.03; p = .929). CRP, a biomarker of inflammation, mediated 32.7% of the total association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 outcome. In conclusion, CRP is a partial mediator of the association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 infection, confirming that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 in diabetes.

Title: 
 Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 levels and DPP4 gene polymorphisms in patients with COVID-19. Association with disease and with severity 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes de COVID-19 disease use as a principal receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). It has been suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) can be another possible receptor for this virus. The present study aimed to establish if the DPP4 levels and DPP4 polymorphisms are associated with COVID-19 disease and its severity. METHODS: The study included 107 COVID-19 patients and 263 matched-healthy controls. Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The DPP4 was quantified in serum using the Bioplex system. Based on the previous results and the functional prediction analysis, we select for the study 5 DPP4 polymorphisms (rs12617336, rs12617656, rs1558957, rs3788979, and rs17574) and these were determined using the 5´exonuclease TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Low levels of DPP4 were observed in COVID-19 patients (46.5 [33.1-57.7] ng/mL) when compared to healthy controls (125.3 [100.3-157.3] ng/mL) (P < 0.0001). Also, patients that required mechanical ventilation showed lower DPP4 levels (42.8 [29.8-56.9] ng/mL) than those that did not need this procedure (49.2 [39.9-65.6] ng/mL) (P = 0.012). DPP4 levels correlated negatively with age, fibrinogen, and platelet levels, and positively with albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and percentage of neutrophils. The DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism was associated with a high risk of COVID-19 disease and, the TT genotype carriers had the lowest DPP4 levels. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in the present study, an association of low levels of DPP4 with COVID-19 disease and severity was found. The association of the DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism with COVID-19 is also reported.

 Praktische Empfehlungen der Deutschen Diabetes Gesellschaft zum Diabetesmanagement bei Patientinnen und Patienten mit einer COVID-19-Erkrankung 
Abstract: 
In subjects with an infection with the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases are highly prevalent comorbidities. Diabetes patients with comorbidities and/or diabetes complications seem to have a higher risk for a severe course of the COVID-19 disease including the development of ARDS or multiorgan failure. The exact interrelations between diabetes and the individual clinical course of COVID-19 are not completely understood at this time. The German Diabetes Association (DDG) summarizes basic principle practice recommendations for the treatment of patients with diabetes and concomitant COVID-19 disease.

 How to Best Protect People With Diabetes From the Impact of SARS-CoV-2: Report of the International COVID-19 and Diabetes Summit 
Abstract: 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has rapidly involved the entire world and exposed the pressing need for collaboration between public health and other stakeholders from the clinical, scientific, regulatory, pharmaceutical, and medical device and technology communities. To discuss how to best protect people with diabetes from serious outcomes from COVID-19, Diabetes Technology Society, in collaboration with Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, hosted the "International COVID-19 and Diabetes Virtual Summit" on August 26-27, 2020. This unique, unprecedented real-time conference brought together physicians, scientists, government officials, regulatory experts, industry representatives, and people with diabetes from six continents to review and analyze relationships between COVID-19 and diabetes. Over 800 attendees logged in. The summit consisted of five sessions: (I) Keynotes, (II) Preparedness, (III) Response, (IV) Recovery, and (V) Surveillance; eight parts: (A) Background, (B) Resilience, (C) Outpatient Care, (D) Inpatient Care, (E) Resources, (F) High-Risk Groups, (G) Regulation, and (H) The Future; and 24 sections: (1) Historic Pandemics and Impact on Society, (2) Pathophysiology/Risk Factors for COVID-19, (3) Social Determinants of COVID-19, (4) Preparing for the Future, (5) Medications and Vaccines, (6) Psychology of Patients and Caregivers, (7) Outpatient Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus and Non-Pharmacologic Intervention, (8) Technology and Telehealth for Diabetes Outpatients, (9) Technology for Inpatients, (10) Management of Diabetes Inpatients with COVID-19, (11) Ethics, (12) Accuracy of Diagnostic Tests, (13) Children, (14) Pregnancy, (15) Economics of Care for COVID-19, (16) Role of Industry, (17) Protection of Healthcare Workers, (18) People with Diabetes, (19) International Responses to COVID-19, (20) Government Policy, (21) Regulation of Tests and Treatments, (22) Digital Health Technology, (23) Big Data Statistics, and 24) Patient Surveillance and Privacy. The two keynote speeches were entitled (1) COVID-19 and Diabetes-Meeting the Challenge and (2) Knowledge Gaps and Research Opportunities for Diabetes and COVID-19. While there was an emphasis on diabetes and its interactions with COVID-19, the panelists also discussed the COVID-19 pandemic in general. The meeting generated many novel ideas for collaboration between experts in medicine, science, government, and industry to develop new technologies and disease treatment paradigms to fight this global pandemic.
