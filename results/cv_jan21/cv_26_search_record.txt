Title: 
 Use of telehealth mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Abstract: 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, specific mental health telehealth services in Australia have been an important source of help for the increasingly stressed population. This study examined trends in the uptake of telehealth items for mental health during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic using administrative Medicare data. During the peak of the pandemic there was a 50% reduction in the in-person consultations for mental health but also a substantial increase in uptake largely of the newly introduced temporary Medicare Benefits Schedule telehealth services. Further, the use of telehealth varied across age, gender and state/territory. These findings have important implications for the allocation of resources for telehealth, both now, and into the post-COVID-19 era.

Title: 
 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response on the utilisation of health services during the first wave in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
Abstract: 
Introduction: Health service use among the general public can decline during infectious disease outbreaks and has been predicted among low and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) implemented public health measures across Kinshasa, including strict lockdown measures in the Gombe health zone, to mitigate impact of the pandemic. Methods: Using data from the Health Management Information System (January 2018 - December 2020), we evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the use of essential health services (total visits, maternal health, vaccinations, visits for common infectious diseases, and diagnosis of non-communicable diseases) using interrupted time series with mixed effects segmented Poisson regression models during the first wave of the pandemic. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, health facility, and neighbourhood. Results: Health service use dropped rapidly following the start of the pandemic and ranged from 16% for hypertension diagnoses to 39% for diabetes diagnoses. However, reductions were highly concentrated in Gombe (81% decline in total visits) relative to health zones without lockdown. When the lockdown was lifted, total visits, visits for infectious diseases, and diagnoses for non-communicable diseases increased approximately two-fold. Hospitals were more affected than health centres. Overall, the use of maternal health services and vaccinations was not significantly affected. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in important reductions in health service utilisation in Kinshasa, particularly Gombe. Lifting of lockdown led to a rebound in the level of health service use but it remained lower than pre-pandemic levels.

Title: 
 Impact of COVID-19 on health services utilization in Province-2 of Nepal: a qualitative study among community members and stakeholders 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges and threats to the health care system, particularly affecting the effective delivery of essential health services in resource-poor countries such as Nepal. This study aimed to explore community perceptions of COVID-19 and their experiences towards health services utilization during the pandemic in Province-2 of Nepal. METHODS: The semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among purposively selected participants (n = 41) from a mix of rural and urban settings in all districts (n = 8) of the Province 2 of Nepal. Virtual interviews were conducted between July and August 2020 in local languages. The data were analyzed using thematic network analysis in NVivo 12 Pro. RESULTS: The findings of this research are categorized into four global themes: i) Community and stakeholders' perceptions towards COVID-19; ii) Impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on health services delivery; iii) Community perceptions and experiences of health services during COVID-19; and iv) COVID-19: testing, isolation, and quarantine services. Most participants shared their experience of being worried and anxious about COVID-19 and reported a lack of awareness, misinformation, and stigma as major factors contributing to the spread of COVID-19. Maternity services, immunization, and supply of essential medicine were found to be the most affected areas of health care delivery during the lockdown. Participants reported that the interruptions in health services were mostly due to the closure of health services at local health care facilities, limited affordability, and involvement of private health sectors during the pandemic, fears of COVID-19 transmission among health care workers and within health centers, and disruption of transportation services. In addition, the participants expressed frustrations on poor testing, isolation, and quarantine services related to COVID-19, and poor accountability from the government at all levels towards health services continuation/management during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that essential health services were severely affected during the COVID-19 pandemic in all districts of Province-2. It is critical to expand and continue the service coverage, and its quality (even more during pandemics), as well as increase public-private sector engagement to ensure the essential health services are available for the population.

Title: 
 Population Health and Health Services: Old Challenges and New Realities in the COVID-19 Era 
Abstract: 
(1) Background: Health services that were already under pressure before the COVID-19 pandemic to maximize its impact on population health, have not only the imperative to remain resilient and sustainable and be prepared for future waves of the virus, but to take advantage of the learnings from the pandemic to re-configure and support the greatest possible improvements. (2) Methods: A review of articles published by the Special Issue on Population Health and Health Services to identify main drivers for improving the contribution of health services on population health is conducted. (3) Health services have to focus not just on providing the best care to health problems but to improve its focus on health promotion and disease prevention. (4) Conclusions: Implementing innovative but complex solutions to address the problems can hardly be achieved without a multilevel and multisectoral deliberative debate. The CHRODIS PLUS policy dialog method can help standardize policy-making procedures and improve network governance, offering a proven method to strengthen the impact of health services on population health, which in the post-COVID era is more necessary than ever.
