Title: 
 IL-6 and IL-10 as predictors of disease severity in COVID-19 patients: results from meta-analysis and regression 
Abstract: 
AIMS: SARS-CoV-2, an infectious agent behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, induces high levels of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ etc in infected individuals that play a role in the underlying patho-physiology Nonetheless, exact association and contribution of every cytokine towards COVID-19 pathology remains poorly understood Delineation of the roles of cytokines during COVID-19 holds the key to efficient patient management in clinics This study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis to establish association between induced cytokines and COVID-19 disease severity to help in prognosis and clinical care MAIN METHODS: Scientific literature was searched to identify 13 cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, TNF-α and IFN-γ) from 18 clinical studies Standardized mean difference (SMD) for selected 6 cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patient groups were summarized using random effects model A classifier was built using logistic regression model with cytokines having significant SMD as covariates KEY FINDINGS: Out of the 13 cytokines, IL-6 and IL-10 showed statistically significant SMD across studies synthesized Classifier with mean values of both IL-6 and IL-10 as covariates performed well with accuracy of ~92% that was significantly higher than accuracy reported in literature with IL-6 and IL-10 as individual covariates SIGNIFICANCE: Simple panel proposed by us with only two cytokine markers can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients with higher risk of COVID-19 disease deterioration and thus can be managed well for a favourable prognosis

Title: 
 Interleukin-18 in Inflammatory Kidney Disease 
Abstract: 
Interleukin (IL)-18, a member of the IL-1 superfamily, is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is structurally similar to IL-1β. IL-18 promotes the production of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and strongly induces a Th1 response. IL-18 drives the same myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway as IL-1β. In physiological conditions, IL-18 is regulated by the endogenous inhibitor IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), and the activity of IL-18 is balanced. It is reported that in several inflammatory diseases, the IL-18 activity is unbalanced, and IL-18 neutralization by IL-18BP is insufficient. IL-18 acts synergistically with IL-12 to induce the production of IFN-γ as a Th1 cytokine, and IL-18 acts alone to induce the production of Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. In addition, IL-18 alone enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity and FAS ligand expression. The biological and pathological roles of IL-18 have been studied in many diseases. Here we review the knowledge regarding IL-18 signaling and the role of IL-18 in inflammatory kidney diseases. Findings on renal injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its association with IL-18 will also be presented.

Title: 
 Interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 inhibition compared with standard management in patients with COVID-19 and hyperinflammation: a cohort study 
Abstract: 
Background: Patients with severe COVID-19 develop a life-threatening hyperinflammatory response to the virus. Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. Methods: This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Findings: Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0·450, 95% CI 0·204-0·990, p=0·047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0·900, 0·412-1·966; p=0·79). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0·866, 95% CI 0·482-1·553; p=0·63) or IL-6 inhibition (0·882, 0·452-1·722; p=0·71) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0·990, 95% CI 0·981-0·999; p=0·031) and adverse clinical outcome (0·987, 0·979-0·995; p=0·0021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1·009, 95% CI 1·003-1·014, p=0·0011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·006, 1·001-1·011, p=0·028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1·006, 1·002-1·010, p=0·0031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·005, 1·001-1·010, p=0·016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. Interpretation: IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibition was effective in a subgroup of patients with markedly high C-reactive protein concentrations, whereas both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition were effective in patients with low lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Funding: None.

Title: 
 The impact of COVID-19 infection on the cytokine profile of pregnant women: A prospective case-control study 
Abstract: 
OBJECTIVE: To compare the levels of various cytokines between pregnant women with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection and pregnant women without any defined risk factor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection (study group)(n = 90) were prospectively compared to a gestational age-matched control group of pregnant women without any defined risk factors (n = 90). Demographic features, clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, interferon-gamma (IFN Î³), interleukin (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 levels were compared between the groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed in the study group for the assessment of IFN Î³, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 levels with disease severity and CRP levels. RESULTS: Study group had significantly higher pregnancy complication rate, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, IFN Î³, and IL-6 values (p < 0.05). On the other hand, the control group had significantly higher hemoglobin, leukocyte, platelet, lymphocyte, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17 values (p < 0.05). Statistically significant differences were found between the groups for IFN Î³, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-17 values between the trimesters (p < 0.05). Statistically significant positive correlations were found for IFN Î³ and IL-6 with disease severity (r = 0.41 and p < 0.001 for IFN Î³ and r = 0.58 and p < 0.001 for IL-6). On the other hand, a moderate negative correlation for IL-2 and a weak negative correlation for IL-10 were present (r = -0.62 and p < 0.001 for IL-2 and r = -0.19 and p = 0.01 for IL-10). A statistically significant positive moderate correlation was found between IL-6 and CRP (r = 0.40 and p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection seems to have an impact on the cytokine profile of pregnant women varying according to pregnancy trimesters and cytokine levels seem to be correlated with disease severity.
