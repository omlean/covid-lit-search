 [Economic Policy Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Air Transport] 
Abstract: 
global air transport passenger traffic has been particularly affected by measures to combat COVID-19 Since February 2020, both the number of global passengers and passenger flight kilometers has decreased worldwide - in Western Europe by about 80 % by the end of 2020 These developments have caused financial losses for both airlines and airports worldwide, critically threatening the existence of a large number of these companies As the industry is of great economic importance, special government support measures could contribute to the economic recovery of the aviation industry However, not only should certain companies be supported, but the support measures should be linked to defined and transparent criteria Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher ger

 Wirtschaftspolitische Implikationen der COVID-19-Pandemie im Luftverkehr 
Abstract: 
global air transport passenger traffic has been particularly affected by measures to combat COVID-19. Since February 2020, both the number of global passengers and passenger flight kilometers has decreased worldwide â€” in Western Europe by about 80 % by the end of 2020. These developments have caused financial losses for both airlines and airports worldwide, critically threatening the existence of a large number of these companies. As the industry is of great economic importance, special government support measures could contribute to the economic recovery of the aviation industry. However, not only should certain companies be supported, but the support measures should be linked to defined and transparent criteria.

 Probability and Estimated Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in the Air Travel System: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis 
Abstract: 
As an emerging virus, SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of transmission during air travel is of high interest. This paper estimates the probability of an infectious index passenger in the air travel system transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to a fellow passenger during air travel. Literature was reviewed from May-September 2020 to identify COVID-19 cases related to the air travel system. The studies were limited to publicly available literature for passengers starting in January 2020; studies on other persons such as flight crews were not reviewed. A novel quantitative approach was developed to estimate air travel transmission risk that considers secondary cases, the overall air travel passenger population, and two correction factors for asymptomatic transmission and underreporting. There were at least 2866 index infectious passengers documented to have passed through the air travel system in a 1.4 billion passenger population. With correction factors, the global risk of transmission during air travel is 1:1.7 million. Uncertainty in the correction factors and a 95% credible interval indicate risk ranges from 1 case for every 712,000 travelers to 1 case for every 8 million travelers. The risk of COVID-19 transmission on an aircraft is low, even with infectious persons onboard.
