 Surviving the Rookie Virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2): The Immunopathology of a SARS-CoV2 Infection. 
Abstract: 
Until July 29th, the number of confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases worldwide has risen to over 16 million, within which 655 k deaths. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) emerges as the 11th global pandemic disease, showing the highest infectivity and lowest infection fatality rate. In this review, we compare the immunopathology among SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and SARS-CoV2. SARS-CoV2 is similar to SARS-CoV; it can cause lymphocytopenia and a rising granulocyte count. Here we point out the human body and concentrated society make for an excellent incubator for virus evolution. Most research energies put into developing the SARS-CoV2 vaccine are trying to block virus infection. Sixty-five percent of severe patients die with multiple organ failure, inflammation, and cytokine storm, which indicates that the patient's immune system maintains functionality. Finding a way to trigger the specific T cell subset and plasmablast in our body is the best shot to get away with SARS-CoV2.

 Identification of multipotent drugs for COVID-19 therapeutics with the evaluation of their SARS-CoV2 inhibitory activity 
Abstract: 
The SARS-CoV2 is a highly contagious pathogen that causes COVID-19 disease. It has affected millions of people globally with an average lethality of â¼3%. There is an urgent need of drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. In the current studies, we have used bioinformatics techniques to screen the FDA approved drugs against nine SARS-CoV2 proteins to identify drugs for repurposing. Additionally, we analyzed if the identified molecules can also affect the human proteins whose expression in lung changed during SARS-CoV2 infection. Targeting such genes may also be a beneficial strategy to curb disease manifestation. We have identified 74 molecules that can bind to various SARS-CoV2 and human host proteins. We experimentally validated our in-silico predictions using vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV2 virus. Interestingly, many of our predicted molecules viz. capreomycin, celecoxib, mefloquine, montelukast, and nebivolol showed good activity (IC50) against SARS-CoV2. We hope that these studies may help in the development of new therapeutic options for the treatment of COVID-19.

 Development of new vaccine target against SARS-CoV2 using envelope (E) protein: An evolutionary, molecular modeling and docking based study 
Abstract: 
COVID-19 is one of the fatal pandemic throughout the world. For cellular fusion, its antigenic peptides are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans. Therefore, exploration into residual interaction details of CoV2 with MHCs shall be a promising point for instigating the vaccine development. Envelope (E) protein, the smallest outer surface protein from SARS-CoV2 genome was found to possess the highest antigenicity and is therefore used to identify B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Four novel mutations (T55S, V56F, E69R and G70del) were observed in E-protein of SARS-CoV2 after evolutionary analysis. It showed a coil➔helix transition in the protein conformation. Antigenic variability of the epitopes was also checked to explore the novel mutations in the epitope region. It was found that the interactions were more when SARS-CoV2 E-protein interacted with MHC-I than with MHC-II through several ionic and H-bonds. Tyr42 and Tyr57 played a predominant role upon interaction with MHC-I. The higher ΔG values with lesser dissociation constant values also affirm the stronger and spontaneous interaction by SARS-CoV2 proteins with MHCs. On comparison with the consensus E-protein, SARS-CoV2 E-protein showed stronger interaction with the MHCs with lesser solvent accessibility. E-protein can therefore be targeted as a potential vaccine target against SARS-CoV2.

 Essential Considerations During Vaccine Design against COVID-19 and Review of Pioneering Vaccine Candidate Platforms 
Abstract: 
The calamity of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), COVID-19, is still a global human tragedy. To date, no specific antiviral drug or therapy has been able to break the widespread of SARS-CoV2. It has been generally believed that stimulating protective immunity via universal vaccination is the individual strategy to manage this pandemic. Achieving an effective COVID-19 vaccine requires attention to the immunological and non-immunological standpoints mentioned in this article. Here, we try to introduce the considerable immunological aspects, potential antigen targets, appropriate adjuvants as well as key points in the various stages of COVID-19 vaccine development. Also, the principal features of the preclinical and clinical studies of pioneering COVID-19 vaccine candidates were pointed out by reviewing the available information. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in the successful design of the COVID-19 vaccine and address the most fundamental strengths and weaknesses of common vaccine platforms.

 Rare SARS-CoV-2 antibody development in cancer patients 
Abstract: 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody development and immunity will be crucial for the further course of the pandemic. Until now, it has been assumed that patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 will develop antibodies as has been the case with other coronaviruses, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In the present study, we analyzed the development of antibodies in 77 patients with an oncologic diagnosis 26 days after positive RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV2. RT-qPCR and anti-SARS-CoV2-antibody methods from BGI (MGIEasy Magnetic Beads Virus DNA/RNA Extraction Kit) and Roche (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay) were used, respectively, according to the manufacturers' specifications. Surprisingly, antibody development was detected in only 6 of 77 individuals with a confirmed history of COVID-19. Despite multiple testing, the remaining patients did not show measurable antibody concentrations in subsequent tests. These results undermine the previous hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 infections are regularly associated with antibody development and cast doubt on the provided immunity to COVID-19. Understanding the adaptive and humoral response to SARS-CoV2 will play a key role in vaccine development and gaining further knowledge on the pathogenesis.
