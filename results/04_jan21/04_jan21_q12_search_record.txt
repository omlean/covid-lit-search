 Innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS‐CoV‐2 in humans: relevance to acquired immunity and vaccine responses 
Abstract: 
The factors responsible for the spectrum of coronavirus 19 (COVID‐19) disease severity and the genesis and nature of protective immunity against COVID‐19 remain elusive. Multiple studies have investigated the immune responses to COVID‐19 in various populations, including those without evidence of COVID‐19 infection. Information regarding innate and adaptive immune responses to the novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has evolved rapidly. Data are accumulating defining disease phenotypes that aid in rational and informed development of new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 and the development of novel vaccines. In this paper, data on important innate immune responses are summarized, including cytokines, specifically interleukin (IL)‐6 and complement, and potential treatments are explored. Adaptive immune responses and derivative therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies directed at spike proteins are also examined. Finally, data on real‐time assessments of adaptive immune responses are explored, which include CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells, natural killer (NK) T cells, memory B cells and T follicular cells with specificities for COVID‐19 peptides in infected and normal individuals. Data of two novel vaccines have been released, both showing > 95% efficacy in preventing SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Analysis of humoral and cellular responses to the vaccines will determine the robustness and durability of protection. In addition, long‐term assessment of SARS‐CoV‐2 memory B and T cell‐mediated immune responses in patients recovering from an infection or those with cross‐reactive immunological memory will help to define risk for future SARS‐CoV infections. Finally, patients recovering from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may experience prolonged immune activation probably due to T cell exhaustion. This will be an important new frontier for study.

Title: 
 Adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 
Abstract: 
This review focuses on adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. A great deal of work has been accomplished in a very short period of time to describe adaptive immune responses and to ascertain their roles in determining the course of infection. As with other viral infections, SARS-CoV-2 elicits both antibody and T-cell responses. Whereas antibody responses are likely effective in preventing infection and may participate in controlling infection once established, it is less clear whether or not they play a role in pathogenesis. T cells are likely involved in controlling established infection, but a pathogenic role is also possible. Longer term evaluation is necessary to determine the durability of protective immune responses.

 Understanding Early-Life Adaptive Immunity to Guide Interventions for Pediatric Health 
Abstract: 
Infants are capable of mounting adaptive immune responses, but their ability to develop long-lasting immunity is limited. Understanding the particularities of the neonatal adaptive immune system is therefore critical to guide the design of immune-based interventions, including vaccines, in early life. In this review, we present a thorough summary of T cell, B cell, and humoral immunity in early life and discuss infant adaptive immune responses to pathogens and vaccines. We focus on the differences between T and B cell responses in early life and adulthood, which hinder the generation of long-lasting adaptive immune responses in infancy. We discuss how knowledge of early life adaptive immunity can be applied when developing vaccine strategies for this unique period of immune development. In particular, we emphasize the use of novel vaccine adjuvants and optimization of infant vaccine schedules. We also propose integrating maternal and infant immunization strategies to ensure optimal neonatal protection through passive maternal antibody transfer while avoiding hindering infant vaccine responses. Our review highlights that the infant adaptive immune system is functionally distinct and uniquely regulated compared to later life and that these particularities should be considered when designing interventions to promote pediatric health.

 Persisting adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in Lower Austria 
Abstract: 
The prevalence and persistence of adaptive immunity responses following a SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights into potential population immunity. Adaptive immune responses comprise of antibody-based responses as well as T cell responses mainly addressing viruses and virus-infected human cells, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of both types of adaptive immunity is essential to follow population-based SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. In this study, we assessed SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels, SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell activities in patients who recovered from a COVID-19 infection in spring and autumn 2020. Here we observed a robust and stable SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune response in both groups with persisting IgA and IgG levels as well as stable T cell activity. Moreover, there was a positive correlation of a lasting immune response with the severity of disease. Our data give evidence for a persisting adaptive immune memory, which suggest a continuing immunity for more than six months post infection.
