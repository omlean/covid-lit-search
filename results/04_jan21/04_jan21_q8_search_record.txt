Title: 
 Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 levels and DPP4 gene polymorphisms in patients with COVID-19. Association with disease and with severity 
Abstract: 
BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes de COVID-19 disease use as a principal receptor the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). It has been suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) can be another possible receptor for this virus. The present study aimed to establish if the DPP4 levels and DPP4 polymorphisms are associated with COVID-19 disease and its severity. METHODS: The study included 107 COVID-19 patients and 263 matched-healthy controls. Fifty patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. The DPP4 was quantified in serum using the Bioplex system. Based on the previous results and the functional prediction analysis, we select for the study 5 DPP4 polymorphisms (rs12617336, rs12617656, rs1558957, rs3788979, and rs17574) and these were determined using the 5´exonuclease TaqMan assays. RESULTS: Low levels of DPP4 were observed in COVID-19 patients (46.5 [33.1-57.7] ng/mL) when compared to healthy controls (125.3 [100.3-157.3] ng/mL) (P < 0.0001). Also, patients that required mechanical ventilation showed lower DPP4 levels (42.8 [29.8-56.9] ng/mL) than those that did not need this procedure (49.2 [39.9-65.6] ng/mL) (P = 0.012). DPP4 levels correlated negatively with age, fibrinogen, and platelet levels, and positively with albumin, alanine aminotransferase, and percentage of neutrophils. The DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism was associated with a high risk of COVID-19 disease and, the TT genotype carriers had the lowest DPP4 levels. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, in the present study, an association of low levels of DPP4 with COVID-19 disease and severity was found. The association of the DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism with COVID-19 is also reported.

The association of the DPP4 rs3788979 polymorphism with COVID-19 is also reported.

Title: 
 Landscape Profiling Analysis of DPP4 in Malignancies: Therapeutic Implication for Tumor Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 
Abstract: 
Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by pneumonia, lymphopenia, and cytokine storms Patients with underlying conditions, and especially cancer patients with impaired immunity, are particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications Although angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been identified as a cellular binding receptor for SARS-CoV-2, immunopathological changes in severe cancer patients support the investigation of additional potential receptors such as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), a key immunoregulator However, a comprehensive profiling analysis of DPP4 in malignancies remains obscure In this study, using different datasets, we demonstrated the expression of DPP4 in healthy tissues and pan-cancers, showing the risk of different cancer types towards SARS-CoV-2 infection according to DPP4 expression levels DPP4 expression was positively correlated with infiltrating levels of various immune cells and showed strong correlations with diverse immune marker sets in pan-cancer patients analyzed by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) These findings suggest that increased DPP4 expression in specific cancer patients might account for the high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the induction of cytokine storms Due to the critical role of DPP4 in immunometabolism, our results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of DPP4 might provide beneficial therapeutic effects for SARS-CoV-2 treatment together with other strategies in specific tumor patients

Title: 
 DPP4 Inhibitors and COVID-19-Holy Grail or Another Dead End? 
Abstract: 
A novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has emerged as a global public health issue. Clinical course of disease significantly correlates with the occurrence of some comorbidities, among them type 2 diabetes. According to recent structural studies the dipeptidyl peptidase 4, a key molecule in the pathophysiology of diabetes, may influence the course of COVID-19. Since DPP4 inhibitors, gliptins, are widely used in diabetes patients, the exact role of DPP4 modulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, at least in that group, urgently needs to be clarified. In this short review, we discuss this issue with more detail.

Title: 
 Use of dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors and prognosis of COVID‐19 in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes: A propensity score analysis from the CORONADO study 
Abstract: 
AIM: To investigate the association between routine use of dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitors and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection in patient with type 2 diabetes in a large multicentric study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of the CORONADO study on 2449 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) hospitalized for COVID‐19 in 68 French centres. The composite primary endpoint combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and death within 7 days of admission. Stabilized weights were computed for patients based on propensity score (DPP‐4 inhibitors users vs. non‐users) and were used in multivariable logistic regression models to estimate the average treatment effect in the treated as inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety‐six participants were under DPP‐4 inhibitors before admission to hospital (24.3%). The primary outcome occurred at similar rates in users and non‐users of DPP‐4 inhibitors (27.7% vs. 28.6%; p = .68). In propensity analysis, the IPTW‐adjusted models showed no significant association between the use of DPP‐4 inhibitors and the primary outcome by Day 7 (OR [95% CI]: 0.95 [0.77–1.17]) or Day 28 (OR [95% CI]: 0.96 [0.78–1.17]). Similar neutral findings were found between use of DPP‐4 inhibitors and the risk of tracheal intubation and death. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the safety of DPP‐4 inhibitors for diabetes management during the COVID‐19 pandemic and they should not be discontinued.
